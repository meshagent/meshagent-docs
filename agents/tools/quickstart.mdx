MeshAgent tools can be run either independently or within an agent. Tools are centrally managed like agents meaning they can be deployed as a MeshAgent service and used by people or agents that have access to your Room. 

## Creating our first custom tool

### Writing a custom tool 
Let's create a simple tool that can add two numbers and connect it to our room. 

First we'll write the logic for the tool itself then we will create a ``RemoteToolkit`` which allows us to run our tool as a MeshAgent Service.

<CodeGroup>
    <ToolsAdder />
</CodeGroup>

### Connecting a custom tool to a MeshAgent Room

From the terminal inside our activated virtual environment we'll run our file. First run the file where your tool is written, for example, run ``python tools.py`` if your file is named tools.py. 

In a separate tab in your terminal use the MeshAgent CLI to call the tool into the room. Pass in the room you want to run the tool in and the service path you've used for the tool. Be sure to authenticate and connect to meshagent before you call the tool into the room!

To connect to MeshAgent:

<CodeGroup>
```bash bash
meshagent setup
```
</CodeGroup>

To call the tool into the Room:

<CodeGroup>
```bash bash
meshagent call tool --room=toolsroom --agent-name=agent --url=http://localhost:7777/adder
```
</CodeGroup>

#### Running a custom tool in the MeshAgent Studio
Now that our tool is running, let's go to [studio.meshagent.com](https://studio.meshagent.com) to try it out!

1. Navigate to the ``toolsroom`` inside the Studio. 
2. Select the menu button in the upper left and click "Run Task". This will allow you to run a TaskRunner and give it our custom tool.
3. Click the "Add Tools" button and select the "adder" tool. Here you will see an info button, an invoke button, and an add button. The info button will display the JSON schema we created to define the tool. The invoke button will invoke the tool directly and the add button will add the tool to a TaskRunner in the Room. Select either the "Invoke" or "Add Tool" option and an agent will launch and run your tool. 
4. The agent will likely ask you for information so it can complete the task. In this case, it will ask you for the values of "a" and "b" so it can proceed with the adding task.

If you want to watch the logs to see the status of the tool call you can click the menu button in the Room again and turn on the "Developer Console". This will allow you to see logs, traces, and metrics as they happen in the Room.

**Note**: Remember if you leave the Room and go back into it later you will need to call the tool back into the Room unless the tool is deployed as a MeshAgent service (meaning you will need to rerun python tools.py and the CLI command to call in the tool to the Room).


#### Running a custom tool from code

As an alternative to running the tool in the studio, you can also call the tool directly from code. Assuming your room is still up and the tool is running in it, we can also invoke the tool using the MeshAgent ``RoomClient``. 

<CodeGroup>
    <ToolsCalling />
</CodeGroup>


# Discovering Tools

At any time, a client can discover what tools have been connected to the room. This can be useful if you want to allow your users to be able to grant additional capabilities to your agents at runtime, or even if you just want to give users the ability to use the tools themselves. 

Running this snippet will show any tool available as a MeshAgent service as well as tools that are temporarily connected to the Room.
