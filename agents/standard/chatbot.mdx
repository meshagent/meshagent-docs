The Chatbot agent allows users to chat with an agent over the MeshAgent messaging protocol. The chatbot supports advanced features like stream responses, thinking indicators, and saving
and loading threads using MeshDocuments.

After joining a MeshAgent room, the Chatbot will show up as a participant on the messaging pane. You can interact with it directly in the studio. You can build your own
custom chatbot by extending the chatbot class and customizing its initialization options:

```python Python
from meshagent.api import RequiredToolkit, RequiredSchema
from meshagent.agents.chat import ChatBot
from meshagent.openai import OpenAIResponsesAdapter

class SampleChatbot(ChatBot):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            # A unique name for the participant
            name="mychatbot",
            # add custom rools to guide the behavior of the chatbot
            rules=[
                "use the ask_user tool to gather information from the user",
            ],
            # Use the OpenAI Responses API
            llm_adapter = OpenAIResponsesAdapter(),
            # Add custom tools
            requires=[
                RequiredToolkit(name="ui", tools=[ "ask_user" ]),
            ],
            toolkits=[
                # Optionally add local toolkits
            ],
            # Add a message that is automatically sent to the user
            auto_greet_message="What would you like me to do?",
        )

```

To send it a message via the room API and integrate it into your own applications, you can send a message using a room client:

```python Python
await room.messaging.send(
    to=participant, 
    type="chat",
    message={
        "path" : "thread_path.thread"
        "text" : "a chat message" 
    })
```

You can use the ChatThreadLoader in the Flutter SDK to integrate the same functionality contained in the MeshAgent Studio interface into your own Flutter applications.

# ComputerAgent

The ComputerAgent in ```meshagent-computers``` extends the chatbot with support for using browsers and computers. The computer agent will periodically send screenshots to participants on the
thread using the MeshAgent messaging protocol, by sending a message of the type "computer_screen" and an attachment that contains a binary screenshot. Install
meshagent-computers to use the ComputerAgent.
