## Overview

MeshAgent is an **end to end platform** for building, deploying, and hosting AI Agents. MeshAgent 
integrates AI Agents and human teams in real time by bundling LLM orchestration, tool integration, real-time messaging, observability, and deployment so you can ship and share agents in minutes instead of weeks. 

### In this guide you will learn how to:
1. Create a MeshAgent account and project in MeshAgent Studio
2. Install MeshAgent for Python
3. Connect to your first MeshAgent Room and call a chat and voice agent into your room

### Prerequisites 

Before you start, make sure your machine matches the appropriate requirements. If you’ve *never* set up Python, pip, or uv before, follow the [**Machine Setup Guide**](../reference/machine_setup) first, then return here.

### Key Concepts
- **Projects**: Groups related Rooms and the Agents that serve them. It is best to create a different Project for each use case.
- **Rooms**: A dedicated space for humans and Agents to collaborate in real time. 
- **Agents**: [ChatBots](../agents/standard/chatbot), [VoiceBots](../agents/standard/voicebot), [TaskRunners](../agents/standard/taskrunner), and [Workers](../agents/standard/worker) that you build and deploy with custom tools or out of the box MeshAgent tools. Once deployed, Agents are automatically available as a project service (available in all rooms in the project) or a room service (available only in the room they're deployed to). 

## Setup Guide
### Step 1: Create an account and project:

1. In a browser, go to [meshagent.com](https://www.meshagent.com/). Sign up or sign into MeshAgent Studio.
2. Create a new project from [MeshAgent Studio](https://studio.meshagent.com) or using the MeshAgent CLI ``meshagent project create my-new-project``
3. Ensure your project has credits to start a room. Go to the **Billing** page to check your credits in the project. All new accounts start with $5. 


### Step 2: Install MeshAgent 
Choose your preferred method: 

#### System-wide installation (recommended for CLI-only use)

<CodeGroup>
```bash macOS
brew tap meshagent/homebrew-meshagent
# install the latest version
brew install meshagent
# Display the help
meshagent --help
```
```bash Windows
# Install
choco install meshagent
# Display the help
meshagent --help

# Alternatively:
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://storage.googleapis.com/meshagent-cli-builds/0.17.1/meshagent.0.17.1.nupkg" -OutFile "C:\Downloads\meshagent.0.17.1.nupkg"
choco install meshagent --source "C:\Downloads\meshagent.0.17.1.nupkg"
```
```bash Other
# One can install the meshagent cli using pipx
pipx install "meshagent[cli]" --include-deps
# Optional: ensure meshagent is in the path. 
# You may need to open a new terminal.
pipx ensurepath
# Display the help
meshagent --help
```
</CodeGroup>

#### Virtual environment installation (for development with Python SDK)

To install the CLI in a virtual environment: Ensure you are in the appropriate project folder and have activated your virtual environment. (The virtual environment is active when the terminal prompt starts with ``venv``.) If you need help with your machine setup check out our [Machine Setup Guide for Python](../reference/machine_setup). Once activated, you can install all the MeshAgent packages, or exclusively the MeshAgent CLI.

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install "meshagent[cli]" # or "meshagent[all]"
```
```bash uv
uv add "meshagent[cli]" # or "meshagent[all]"
```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 3: Use the MeshAgent CLI to Connect to a Project

Authenticate and activate a project. 

<CodeGroup>
```bash bash
# A browser window will open for OAuth.
# Next the terminal will ask you to select or create a project.
meshagent setup
```
</CodeGroup>

__Optional__: Alternatively, instead of running the `meshagent setup` command you can run:

<CodeGroup>
```bash bash
# A browser window will open for OAUTH.
meshagent auth login
meshagent project activate -i
# create an api key if necessary. The key value will be displayed only once.
meshagent api-key create --activate my-key
```
</CodeGroup>

You are now authenticated and ready to use the CLI! 

### Step 4: Start and chat with an agent in a MeshAgent room

We can use the CLI to start pre-built agents. For example, let's call a chatbot and voicebot into a new room and talk to them in MeshAgent Studio. 

```sh
# Start a chat agent in the room "gettingstarted"
meshagent chatbot join --room gettingstarted --agent-name chatagent 

# Start a voicebot in the same room
meshagent voicebot join --room gettingstarted --agent-name voiceagent
```

Now open [studio.meshagent.com](https://studio.meshagent.com/) and join the ``gettingstarted`` session. In the participants tab you will see the ``chatagent`` and ``voiceagent`` appear. To talk to the agent, just select it from the participants list and begin chatting! 

These agents will be available in the Room while you're running them from your terminal. If you want the agents to persist, you'll need to deploy them as a project or room service. 

> **Tip**: Mute your mic after speaking to avoid background noise triggering the voice agent.
