title: Share Agents in Powerboards
---

[Powerboards](https://www.powerboards.com/) is an open-source, AI-native app built entirely on MeshAgent. You can use Powerboards as-is to share your agents today, or adapt the source code into your own MeshAgent-powered application.

Powerboards is included in your MeshAgent account and gives teams a shared space to collaborate, create, and grow together. While [MeshAgent Studio](https://studio.meshagent.com) is a great tool for developers building agents with MeshAgent, Powerboards is designed for your end users so they can easily interact with the agents you build from day one. Since the app is open-source you can also adapt it to your needs!

## How to share agents in Powerboards
Conversational agents ([ChatBots](../../agents/standard/chatbot) and [VoiceBots](../../agents/standard/voicebot)) deployed with MeshAgent can be used immediately in Powerboards. Package and deploy your agent as a project service or ServiceTemplate, and include both of these fields in your `meshagent.yaml` so Powerboards can discover it:

- In the `agents` list: set `annotations.meshagent.agent.type` to `ChatBot` or `VoiceBot`
- In `ports[].endpoints[]`: add a `meshagent.identity` that matches the agent name

After you deploy the service to your project, Powerboards lists it under **Agents → Manage agents** alongside the built-in defaults (assistant, voice, developer, transcriber). Your deployed agents show up in the same list for users to add to their rooms. 

### Example: ChatBot with a custom rules file
The example below packages a ChatBot with a rules file and exposes it so Powerboards and MeshAgent Studio can install it. Bundle your rules file into the image and point the CLI ChatBot at it with `-rr` or ``--room-rules``.

````markdown
├── Dockerfile
├── meshagent.yaml
└── agents/
    └── chatbot/
        └── rules.txt
````

Example `agents/chatbot/rules.txt`:

```text rules.txt
You are a MeshAgent ChatBot running inside Powerboards. Powerboards is an AI-native collaboration app built entirely on MeshAgent, the operating layer for agentic AI. 
- You can learn more about Powerboards and MeshAgent by using the web search tool and researching meshagent.com and docs.meshagent.com.
- Use the same language the user is using; do not switch languages unless they do.
- If you need context about the room or project, ask concise follow-up questions first.
``` 

```Dockerfile Dockerfile
FROM meshagent/cli:latest
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
# Optional: install extra deps here
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/meshagent/meshagent", "chatbot", "service", "--agent-name=chatbot", "-rr=agents/chatbot/rules.txt", "--web-search"]
```

> **Note**: We use the CLI base image because the entrypoint runs the CLI `chatbot service` command. `/usr/bin/meshagent/meshagent` is the CLI path baked into that image; you can also call `meshagent` if you prefer. The `--web-search` flag enables the built-in web search toolkit—remove it if you don’t want that capability. If you’re packaging a custom Python chatbot instead of the CLI chatbot, use `meshagent/python-sdk-slim` and run your Python entrypoint.

```yaml meshagent.yaml
kind: Service
version: v1
metadata:
  name: custom-chatbot
  description: "ChatBot with custom rules for Studio and Powerboards"
agents:
  - name: chatbot
    annotations:
      meshagent.agent.type: "ChatBot"
ports:
  - num: "*"
    type: http
    liveness: "/"
    endpoints:
      - path: /agent
        meshagent:
          identity: chatbot
container:
  image: "myrepo/custom-chatbot:1.0.0"
```
> **Note**: ``chatbot join`` vs ``chatbot service``: `meshagent chatbot join` is for local/dev sessions (e.g., running on your laptop). To deploy agents in Powerboards or Studio, use `meshagent chatbot service` in your container/entrypoint as shown above. See [CLI getting started](../../cli/getting_started) for examples of both.

Build, push, and deploy as a project service:

```bash
docker buildx build . -t myrepo/custom-chatbot:1.0.0 --platform linux/amd64 --push
meshagent setup
meshagent service create --file meshagent.yaml # optional add --room=myroom
```

Once deployed, the agent uses the `agents/chatbot/rules.txt` when users add it to a Room. In MeshAgent Studio it will appear automatically in the Participants tab to chat with; in Powerboards you can add it from **Agents → Manage agents**. 

Deploying an agent with the `-rr` or ``--room-rules`` flag makes it so that the rules for that agent are publicly available and editable inside the Room, this is great if you want people who use the agent to be able to edit it's rules. If you want to deploy an agent with a specific non-editable set of rules you can use the ``--rules-file`` flag instead, this will keep the rules invisible and uneditable to users.

> **Tip:** You can layer rules: keep non-editable base rules in the image with `--rules-file`, and add `--room-rules` so users can supply their own room-specific rules in Studio or Powerboards.

### Share your agent in Powerboards

From [Powerboards](https://powerboards.com) you can now install agents and invite people to interact with them! To invite people to your room, select the room menu, permissions, and then invite users via email. They will be able to instantly join the room and work with you and your agents!
