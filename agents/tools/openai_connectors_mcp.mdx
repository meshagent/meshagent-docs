In addition to MeshAgent Tools, agents can also use external tools through [OpenAI Connectors and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-connectors-mcp). 

- **OpenAI Connectors**: OpenAI-maintained MCP wrappers for third party services that don't have official MCP servers (Gmail, Google Drive, Outlook, Microsoft Teams, Dropbox etc.). Using these connectors requires OAuth client registration and authorization with the provider. 
- **Remote MCP servers**: Any MCP server operated by you or a third party. You provide the server URL and any required authentication details, and the agent can call the server's MCP tools. 

## Two ways to use MCP Tools & OpenAI Connectors in MeshAgent
### 1. User-Toggleable Tools (Per-Message)
Use this when you want users to **choose tools on demand**, per message or per conversation — similar to ChatGPT/Claude tool toggles.

**Examples**
- “Enable Google Drive only for this question”
- “Use Teams for this message, but not the next”
- Avoid tool bloat by not attaching dozens of tools permanently

**How it works**
- You deploy MCP servers / connectors as services so they’re available in a room/project
- Your agent is configured to accept MCP tools dynamically
- Your UI lets users toggle tools on/off, and passes the selection to the agent

**Best for**
- ChatGPT-style experiences  
- Reducing agent bloat by deploying multiple tools and toggling them on/off as needed during interactive agent sessions
- Best when tools require explicit approval

### 2. Always-On Tools (Agent-Owned)
Use this when your agent should **always** have access to specific tools.

**Examples**
- A support agent that always needs ticketing tools
- A repo assistant that always needs GitHub MCP tools
- A bot that always reads from a single internal system

**How it works**
- You attach MCP tools to the agent via the SDK (`toolkits`), or deploy an agent/service that includes them.
- The agent will always have these tools available on every turn.

**Best for**
- Agents that routinely need access to certain tools 
- Background agents who should have access to the tool by default
- Cases when users should not choose tools manually

In both cases, MeshAgent talks to OpenAI via the [`OpenAIResponsesAdapter`](../adapters/openai_responses_adapter). This adapter gathers the toolkits available to the agent on that turn, manages tool execution, streaming responses, and returning the final result. 
Tool lists are rebuilt on every user message by merging always-on toolkits with any user-selected toolkits for that turn. For the full flow see [Tool Usage Patterns](./tool_usage_patterns).

## User-Toggleable Tools (Per-Message)
This section shows you how to let users dynamically enable/disable OpenAI Connectors and MCP servers per conversation or message — similar to how ChatGPT and Claude let you toggle tools on and off.

### When to use user-toggleable tools

Use this mode when you want users to control which capabilities are available on demand. This helps reduce agent bloat by avoiding deployments where each agent has a different permutation of tools. If an agent should always have specific capabilities, you can use the always-on approach instead (attach tools via `toolkits`).

> **Note:** Even with user-toggleable tools, users can enable multiple (or even all) tools at once. The difference is that tools are opt-in per message, rather than permanently attached to the agent.

User-toggleable tools are supported automatically when you run the CLI ChatBot with flags like `--mcp`. This enables per-message tool selection and is supported in MeshAgent Studio and Powerboards automatically. You can implement the same pattern when building agents with the MeshAgent SDK by adding toolkit builders (e.g. `MCPToolkitBuilder()`) and passing the user's tool selection to the agent each turn. 

### How user-toggleable tools work 
User-toggleable MCP tool selection has three pieces:
1. Deployed services that expose MCP servers or OpenAI Connectors
2. An agent configured to accept MCP tools dynamically
3. A UI that displays available services and lets users toggle them on/off

MeshAgent Studio and Powerboards handle the UI integration automatically.

## Example 1: Dynamic MCP Tools in MeshAgent
### Step 1: Create the Service YAML
First you need to [package](../../services_room_containers/packaging) and [deploy](../../services_room_containers/deployment) a project or room service for the MCP Servers or OpenAI Connectors you want the agent to have access to. You can do this by defining a service yaml file and deploying the service using the MeshAgent CLI. 

For example, let's deploy the [DeepWiki MCP Server](https://docs.devin.ai/work-with-devin/deepwiki-mcp) which provides tools for reading public GitHub repositories (no authentication required). To do so we'll create a YAML file that defines the service and deploy it with the CLI.

Create a `meshagent.yaml` file for the MCP DeepWiki service.

<CodeGroup>
  <MCPDeepWikiTool />
</CodeGroup>

### Step 2: Deploy the service 
```bash
meshagent service create --file="meshagent.yaml"  --room=quickstart
```

### Step 3: Configure your agent to accept MCP tools
Your agent needs to be configured with `MCPToolkitBuilder()` so it can accept tools selected by the user. The CLI ChatBot does this automatically with the `--mcp` flag. 

```bash
meshagent chatbot join --room=quickstart --agent-name=agent --mcp
```

> **Note:** The CLI ChatBot also supports other dynamic toolkits like `--web-search` and `--storage` that work similarly. They add toolkit builders so users can enable/disable these capabilities per message.

**For custom ChatBots, you must add it manually:**
```python python
from meshagent.openai.tools.responses_adapter import MCPToolkitBuilder

class MyChatBot(ChatBot):
    def get_toolkit_builders(self):
        builders = super().get_toolkit_builders()
        builders.append(MCPToolkitBuilder())  # Add this!
        return builders
```

### Step 4: Test in MeshAgent Studio
Go to [MeshAgent Studio](https://studio.meshagent.com) and try out the ChatBot, you'll be able to turn on the MCP DeepWiki tool from the UI. The UI automatically discovers and displays available services and shows them as selectable tools that users can toggle on/off. If you're building a custom UI, you'll need to implement similar discovery and selection functionality.

## Example 2: Create a MeshAgent Service for an OpenAI Connector

OpenAI Connectors require OAuth authentication. You'll need to register an OAuth client with the service provider first. See [OpenAI's documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-connectors-mcp) for additional instructions.

Once you register your OAuth API client you can create and deploy the service just like we did for the MCP Server. 

### Step 1: Create the Service YAML

<CodeGroup>
  <OpenAIConnectorTool />
</CodeGroup>

### Step 2: Deploy the service
```bash
meshagent service create --file="meshagent.yaml"  --room=quickstart
```

### Step 3: Start the CLI ChatBot with MCP Enabled
```bash
meshagent chatbot join --room=quickstart --agent-name=agent --mcp
# make sure room matches room you deployed to if deployed as a room service
```

### Step 4: Use It in MeshAgent Studio
Open [MeshAgent Studio](https://studio.meshagent.com), go to your room, and you'll see "Microsoft Teams" as a toggleable tool. Enable it to let the agent read Teams messages!

## Example 3: Always-on MCP Tools with MeshAgent

### Step 1: Define a `ChatBot` with MCP Tools
Let's create a [`ChatBot`](../standard/chatbot) that can use the public [DeepWiki MCP Server](https://docs.devin.ai/work-with-devin/deepwiki-mcp) which does not require an access token or OAuth. 

For this ChatBot we'll define: 
- A `Toolkit`: a collection of related tools the agent can use
- An `MCPTool`: connects to an MCP server
- `MCPConfig`: configuration for the MCP connection
- `MCPServer`: the actual server details (URL, authentication details)

<CodeGroup>
  <MCPChatBot />
</CodeGroup>

### Step 2: Run and test the agent 
Run it locally and try it in MeshAgent Studio:

```bash bash 
meshagent service run "main.py" --room=quickstart
```

From [MeshAgent Studio](https://studio.meshagent.com), enter `quickstart`, and start talking to the agent. Ask it about public GitHub repositories and it will use the DeepWiki MCP tools to respond. For example you can ask "What's in the README on the Pydantic AI repository?". 

### Step 3: Package and deploy the agent
Once satisfied with the agent, we can [package](../../services_room_containers/packaging) and [deploy](../../services_room_containers/deployment) it as a project service so it's automatically available to all the rooms in a project, or as a room service so it's always available in a specific room. 

To do so you'll need to:
1. Create a Dockerfile, build/push the container (or use the available meshagent image) 
2. Create a yaml file that defines the service
3. Deploy it using the MeshAgent CLI. 

**(Optional) Create your container** If you want to create your own image you'll need to create a Dockerfile and build and push a container. 

```Dockerfile Dockerfile
FROM meshagent/python-sdk-slim:latest
COPY . /src
WORKDIR /src
ENTRYPOINT [ "python3", "main.py" ]
```

```bash 
docker buildx build . \
  -t "$IMAGE:$TAG" \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  --push
```

**Create a `meshagent.yaml` file that defines the service**

If you built and pushed your own container you can update the container path in the YAML file below. Otherwise you can use the meshagent container. 

<CodeGroup>
  <MCPChatBotYAML/>
</CodeGroup>

**Deploy the service**

```bash bash
meshagent service create --file "meshagent.yaml" --room=quickstart 
```

**Step 5: Use Your Deployed Agent**

Next open [MeshAgent Studio](https://studio.meshagent.com), go to a room where the service is deployed, and begin talking to the ChatBot.

## Security and best practices
When adding external tools like MCP Servers or OpenAI Connectors consider: 
- What data you're sharing with external services
- Who operates the MCP servers you connect to  
- Whether agents should require approval before using certain tools
