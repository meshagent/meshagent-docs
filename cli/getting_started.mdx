## Create an account and project:

1. In a browser, go to [www.meshagent.com](https://www.meshagent.com/). Sign in with an existing account or sign up for an new account. 
2. In the web ui, if necessary, create a new project and give it a name (e.g., MyProject)
3. Note: Ensure your project has credits to start a room. Go to the Billing page.

## Using the MeshAgent CLI

Install the cli and authenticate:
<CodeGroup>
```bash Python
pip3 install meshagent-cli
# A browser window will open for OAUTH.
meshagent auth login
```
</CodeGroup>

List the projects and activate one of them:
<CodeGroup>
```bash Python
meshagent project list
# Use a project id returned from the previous command
meshagent project activate [project-id]
```
</CodeGroup>

Create and activate an api key:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Python
meshagent api-key create --name my-key
meshagent api-key list
# Use the key id returned from the previous command
meshagent api-key activate [key-id-for-my-key]
```
</CodeGroup>

You are now authenticated and ready to use the cli to perform operations involving a room. Let's connect a chatbot to a room.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Python
meshagent chatbot join --room my-room --agent-name "Chat Agent" --name "Chat Friend"
```
</CodeGroup>

The chatbot is now connected. In a web browser, go to [studio.meshagent.com](https://studio.meshagent.com/). 
Select your project and join the my-room session.

The chatbot agent named "Chat Friend" will be visible in the room and can be interacted with.

If you wish to logout:
<CodeGroup>
```bash Python
meshagent auth logout
```
</CodeGroup>
