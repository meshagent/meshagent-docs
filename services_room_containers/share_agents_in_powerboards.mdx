[Powerboards](https://www.powerboards.com/) is a (soon to be) open-source, AI-native app built entirely on MeshAgent. It gives teams a shared space to interact with the agents you build. While [MeshAgent Studio](https://studio.meshagent.com) is a great tool for developers building agents with MeshAgent, Powerboards is designed for your end users so they can easily interact with the agents you build from day one.

Powerboards is included in your MeshAgent account. You can use it as-is to share your agents today, or adapt the source code into your own MeshAgent-powered application.

## How agents get into Powerboards
There are two ways agents appear in Powerboards:
1. **Share your agent with anyone via an install link** 
   - If you want anyone to be able to install your agent into their own room — even in projects you don't control — you can create an install link from a service configuration file that's hosted publicly. When someone clicks the link, Powerboards walks them through adding the agent to their own Project and Room.  
    - This allows you to easily share agents at scale. 
2. **Deploy agents in projects/rooms you're a member of with the MeshAgent CLI** 
   - The CLI allows you to deploy agents directly with commands like  `meshagent chatbot deploy...` or from a configuration file using commands like `meshagent service create...` for static configurations or `meshagent service create-template...` for dynamic configurations (e.g. if a user needs to provide an email for an agent). 
   - Agents deployed with the MeshAgent CLI automatically appear in the corresponding Powerboards room. 

## Installing an agent from a link
The fastest way to install an agent in Powerboards is from a link. 

When you click an install link, Powerboards will: 
1. Prompt you to sign in or create an account.
2. Ask you to select a **Project** and **Room** to deploy the service.
3. Prompt for any required values defined in the ServiceTemplate's `variables` (such as API keys, email addresses, or settings).
4. Create any necessary secrets and deploy the service automatically.

Install links look like this: 
  ```
  https://app.powerboards.com/install?url=SERVICE_TEMPLATE_SPEC_URL
  ```

If you already have an install link you can start using the agent immediately, you don't need to write any code or use the CLI. Just click the link and follow the prompts. 

The rest of this page explains how to make agents show up in Powerboards and package an agent so that it can be shared with an install link. 

## Creating an install link
To make your service shareable via an install link, you need a `ServiceTemplate` YAML hosted at a publicly accessible URL. For more information on Services and ServiceTemplates see the [packaging and deploying](./packaging_and_deploying/packaging) guide. 

### Step 1: Write the configuration file
Your `ServiceTemplate` must include `meshagent.service.id` in `metadata.annotations` so Powerboards can identify the service. 

If your service provides agents, include the agents section with `meshagent.agent.type` annotations so Powerboards knows how to display them. Include a `variables` section for any values users need to provide at install time.

Here's a simple example — a chatbot with a web search tool that users can customize with an initial rule when they install it: 

<CodeGroup>
  <PowerboardsChatbotCustomRule />
</CodeGroup>

When a user installs this via Powerboards, they'll be prompted to input `agent_rule`. Powerboards fills in the `{{ }} ` placeholder and deploys the service. The agent will appear in Powerboards under the service name — in this case, "my-chatbot."

### Step 2: Host the YAML

The easiest way to host a `ServiceTemplate` is using a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/).

1. Create a new gist (public or secret - either is fine, as long as anyone with the link can read it).
2. Paste your YAML and name the file (for example `meshagent.yaml`).
3. Save the gist.
4. Click **Raw** and copy the **raw file URL from the browser bar**.

Powerboards loads the template **from the browser**, so the URL must be accessible over CORS. Raw GitHub Gist URLs already work with CORS by default, so you don’t have to configure anything.

You can also use any other public URL, but if you’re hosting it yourself you’ll need to make sure the YAML is publicly reachable and that the server allows cross-origin GET requests from the Powerboards web app.

### Step 3. Construct and share the install link
Prefix your raw URL with the Powerboards install path:

``https://app.powerboards.com/install?url=SERVICE_TEMPLATE_SPEC_URL``

Where `SERVICE_TEMPLATE_SPEC_URL` is the URL-encoded version of your YAML file’s URL (for example, the raw Gist URL).

Now you can share the link with anyone! They will be prompted to choose a Project and Room to install their agent! 

## Managing Agents in Powerboards
Agents deployed via the CLI or install links can be managed from Powerboards:
1. Open our room in [Powerboards](https://app.powerboards.com).
2. Select the Agents dropdown → Manage Agents.
3. From here you can uninstall agents you no longer need.

To invite others to use the agents in your room, click the **Invite** button at the top of the screen or select the Room menu → Permissions and invite users via email. They must be members of the project already, or you must be a project admin to invite them.

## Editable agent rules and collaboration in Powerboards
Powerboards lets room members customize agent behavior together. The default agents (`assistant`, `developer`, `voice`) each have an editable `rules.txt` file in Room storage that users can edit to steer the agent’s behavior. When you create your own agents and share them in Powerboards, you control if and how editable those rules are.

There are three ways to provide rules to an agent: 
- `--rule`: Inline rules baked into the service definition. These are fixed and cannot be edited after deployment. Best for core instructions that should never change.
- `--room-rules`: Creates a file in room storage (e.g. agents/my-chatbot/rules.txt) that anyone in the room can edit. Changes take effect without redeploying the service. Best for instructions that teams should be able to refine as they work with the agent.
- `--rules-file`: Reads a rules file baked into the container image. Not editable by room members. Useful for custom images with fixed instructions.


You can combine these, for example, use `--rule` for fixed baseline behavior and `--room-rules` for editable customization on top. The example `ServiceTemplate` above uses both `--rule` and `--room-rules` together.

When an agent with `--room-rules` is deployed and available in Powerboards, room members can edit the rules file directly from the Powerboards UI to customize the agent's behavior.
