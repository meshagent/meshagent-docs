`SyncClient` enables interacting with managed documents - `MeshDocument` and synchronizing local changes with all remote clients.

---

## Overview

MeshDocuments enable your agents to share and synchronize information in real time across platforms. They resemble a web page's structure but offer much greater flexibility. For example, if you want to generate website content with your agents, you can start with a simple HTML-compatible document format:

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <p class="content"></p>
    </body>
</html>
```

A MeshDocument, like an HTML document, is composed of elements that can have child elements and attributes. However, MeshDocuments introduce additional features and capabilities that go beyond standard HTML or XML.

## Defining Your Document Structure

To define the structure of a MeshDocument, you start by creating a schema using the MeshSchema class. A schema:

- Documents the structure of your MeshDocument for anyone in your organization.
- Ensures agents and users don’t write invalid data to the document.
- Allows agents to automatically generate, manipulate, and validate structured documents.
- Automatically generates LLM-compatible schemas for structured outputs.
- Synchronizes documents across all platforms that MeshAgent supports.

Similar to how a web page is structured, a MeshSchema begins with a root element that includes an allowed tag name and optional attributes. Afterward, you can define additional tags, their attributes, and the types of child nodes they can contain.

### Example Schema

Suppose you have a basic web page structure and want to define a schema for it.

<CodeGroup>
    <SchemasHtmlPy />
    <SchemasHtmlJs />
    <SchemasHtmlTs />
    <SchemasHtmlDart />
</CodeGroup>

Many LLMs (such as OpenAI) and agent frameworks (such as MeshAgent) support JSON Schemas for defining inputs and outputs. Generating an OpenAI-compatible JSON schema from your MeshSchema requires only one line of code:

<CodeGroup>
``` python Python
json_schema = schema.to_json()
```
``` javascript JavaScript
const jsonSchema = schema.toJson();
```
``` typescript TypeScript
const jsonSchema: Record<string, any> = schema.toJson();
```
``` dart Dart
final jsonSchema = schema.toJson();
```
</CodeGroup>


## Creating a MeshDocument

To create a MeshDocument based on your schema and enable synchronization across different clients, use the MeshAgent runtime:

<CodeGroup>
    <DocumentsWritingPy />
    <DocumentsWritingJs />
    <DocumentsWritingTs />
    <DocumentsWritingDart />
</CodeGroup>


## API Methods

Below is an example of how you might use the `SyncClient` in your code:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python

# Create a MeshDocument on the server
await room.sync.create("my/path", json={"initial": "data"})

# Open a document (creates if not found)
doc = await room.sync.open("my/path", create=True)

# Close the document
await room.sync.close("my/path")
```
```js JavaScript
// Create a MeshDocument on the server
await room.sync.create("my/path", {"initial": "data" });

// Open a document (creates if not found)
const doc = await room.sync.open("my/path", { create: true });

// Close the document
await room.sync.close("my/path");
```
```ts TypeScript
// Create a MeshDocument on the server
await room.sync.create("my/path", {"initial": "data" });

// Open a document (creates if not found)
const doc = await room.sync.open("my/path", { create: true });

// Close the document
await room.sync.close("my/path");
```
```dart Dart
// Create a MeshDocument on the server
await room.sync.create("my/path", {"initial": "data"});

// Open a document (creates if not found)
final doc = await syncClient.open("my/path", create: true);

// Close the document
await room.sync.close("my/path");
```
</CodeGroup>

### `SyncClient`

The `SyncClient` class is responsible for coordinating document synchronization through a `RoomClient`. It automatically listens for local changes on `MeshDocument` instances and forwards them to the remote server, while also applying remote changes as they are received.

- **`room: RoomClient`**  
  An instance of `RoomClient`, which handles the underlying communication with the server.


#### `create(path, json?)`

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
await room.sync.create(path="my/path", json={"key": "value"})
```
```js JavaScript
await room.sync.create("my/path", { key: "value" });
```
```ts TypeScript
await room.sync.create("my/path", { key: "value" });
```
```dart Dart
await room.sync.create("my/path", {"key": "value"});
```
</CodeGroup>


- **Parameters**:
  - `path` – The path where the document will be created on the server.
  - `schema` – A `MeshSchema` describing the structure of the document.
  - `json` – (Optional) Initial data or metadata to send along with the creation request.
- **Description**  
  Sends a request to create a new `MeshDocument` at the given path with a specified schema.

#### `open(path, create = true)`

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
doc = await sync_client.open("my/path", create=True)
```
```js JavaScript
const doc = await syncClient.open("my/path", { create: true });
```
```ts TypeScript
const doc = await syncClient.open("my/path", { create: true });
```
```dart Dart
final doc = await syncClient.open("my/path", create: true);
```
</CodeGroup>


- **Parameters**:
  - `path` – The path identifying the document to open.
  - `create` – (Optional) Whether to create the document if it doesn’t exist. Defaults to `true`.
- **Returns**  
  A `MeshDocument` instance tied to the specified path.
- **Description**  
  Sends a request to connect to (and possibly create) the document at the given path. If successful, returns a reference-counted `MeshDocument` that automatically sends local changes to the backend.

#### `close(path)`

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
await room.sync.close("my/path")
```
```js JavaScript
await room.sync.close("my/path");
```
```ts TypeScript
await room.sync.close("my/path");
```
```dart Dart
await room.sync.close("my/path");
```
</CodeGroup>


- **Parameters**:
  - `path` – The path of the document to close.
- **Description**  
  Decrements the internal reference count for the document. If it reaches zero, the document is unregistered locally, and a request is sent to the server to disconnect. No further changes will be synced once closed.


#### `sync(path, data)`

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
await room.sync.sync("my/path", b"some bytes")
```
```js JavaScript
await room.sync.sync("my/path", new Uint8Array([/*...bytes...*/]));
```
```ts TypeScript
await room.sync.sync("my/path", new Uint8Array([/*...bytes...*/]));
```
```dart Dart
await room.sync.sync("my/path", Uint8List.fromList([/*...bytes...*/]));
```
</CodeGroup>


- **Parameters**:
  - `path` – The path of the document to synchronize.
  - `data` – A `Uint8Array` (or equivalent) containing serialized changes.
- **Description**  
  Immediately sends sync data to the server. This method is useful if you have already encoded your changes and want to bypass the typical queued flow.

---

## Additional Notes

- **Synchronized Changes**  
  Once a document is opened, any local changes you make in the associated `MeshDocument` are automatically queued for sending, thanks to `sendChangesToBackend`. You rarely need to call `sync()` manually unless you want to send raw data yourself.

- **Reference Counting**  
  The `SyncClient` internally tracks how many times a document is opened via the same path. Calling `open` multiple times for the same path returns the same underlying document. Only when all references are closed (via `close()`) will the client actually disconnect.

- **Error Handling**  
  If a request fails, the `RoomClient` may throw an error (like `RoomServerException`). Wrap calls in `try/catch` (or use `.catch(...)`) to handle them gracefully.

- **Concurrency and Performance**  
  - For high throughput, ensure that your `RoomClient` and server are configured for concurrent operations.
  - The `SyncClient` uses a `StreamController` internally to manage queued updates, sending them asynchronously to the server.

- **Extensibility**  
  You can extend the `SyncClient` for specialized document operations—such as partial updates, conflict resolution logic, or customized schema handling—by adding new methods or composing it with other classes that also use `RoomClient`.
