### PREVIOUSLY IN ROOM SERVICES 
**Using the MeshAgent CLI**
From the directory with your code, Dockerfile, and meshagent.yaml run: 

```bash 
meshagent setup # authenticate to MeshAgent if not already connected
# build and push your container to a registry 
# e.g. docker buildx build -t "$IMAGE:$TAG" --platform linux/amd64 --push
meshagent container run --room=myroom --image=chatbot:0.1 --var system_prompt="Always respond with a fun fact"
```

**To test the agent**: 
1. Go to [MeshAgent Studio](https://studio.meshagent.com)
2. Select the **Sessions** tab then open ``myroom``
3. You'll see the chatbot in the participants tab. 
 
**Troubleshooting**: 
Inside your room in the studio look at the **Developer Console** on the bottom of the screen. Here you'll see images in the room, containers running, and builds. From the images tab you should see the image you built "chatbot:0.1", this should be green. If it is not green that means the image did not build properly and could indicate that you are missing the meshagent.yaml file. From the containers tab you should see the image running and who started it, you can also click into the container logs from this view. 


## Next Steps
Containers run on demand, and will not automatically restart the next time you go into the room. If you want a container with your configuration to save and start automatically the next time the room starts, you will need to deploy a project wide service to manage the containers. Otherwise you can start containers as needed through the CLI/API.
