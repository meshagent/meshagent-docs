title: Example: Deploying a Chatbot as a Project Service
---


## Example

Let's create a simple chatbot that can be deployed to all the rooms in our project. To deploy this we'll need the main.py file, a Dockerfile, and a meshagent.yaml file.

### main.py

```python Python
import os
import asyncio
import logging
from meshagent.agents.chat import ChatBot
from meshagent.api.services import ServiceHost
from meshagent.openai import OpenAIResponsesAdapter

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

host = ServiceHost()

@host.path("/agent")
class MyChatBot(ChatBot): 
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name="chatbot",
            llm_adapter=OpenAIResponsesAdapter(),
        )

asyncio.run(host.run())
```

### Dockerfile

```Dockerfile Dockerfile
FROM meshagent/python-sdk-slim:latest

COPY . /src

WORKDIR /src

ENTRYPOINT [ "python3", "main.py" ]
```

### meshagent.yaml
```yaml yaml
kind: Service
version: v1
name: chatbot

ports:
- num: "*"
  liveness: "/"
  endpoints:
  - path: /agent
    identity: chatbot
    type: meshagent.callable
```

## Build and Push the Container
Now that we've defined our agent and written the applicable Dockerfile and meshagent.yaml we can build and push the docker container. 


## Deploy the Project-Wide Service
From the terminal in the directory with your yaml file simply run:

```bash bash
meshagent setup # authenticate to MeshAgent if not already done
meshagent service create "service.yaml"
```

For more details on deployment see [deploy and run project services](./deployment)

## Use the Service
Now that your service is deployed try it out in [MeshAgent Studio](https://studio.meshagent.com). You'll see the new service in the **Services** tab of the UI. To use the service, simply start a new session and enter the room, the chatbot will appear in the participants tab for you to interact with.
