## Python Development Environment Setup

This page takes you from zero tooling to the point where you can run any command in the [**Getting Started**](../introduction/get_started) guide.

In this document we will walk through: 
- Setting up your IDE, terminal, and GitHub account
- Installing Python
- Choosing and installing a Python package manager (we recommend uv)
- Creating a Repository and Project Folder to run the code
- Setting up a virtual environment
- Installing MeshAgent

## Step 0: Install an IDE, terminal, and create a GitHub account

If you don't already have a code editor installed, download one of your choice, for example [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/), or [Cursor](https://cursor.com/en). 

You can also install a more sophisticated terminal like [warp](https://www.warp.dev/) which makes development even easier.

Creating a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account will make it easier for you to manage your code projects. We recommend creating an account and installing the [GitHub Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://cli.github.com/) to make GitHub management seamless. Follow the installation instructions for the GitHub CLI based on your machine.

## Step 1: Install Python 3.12+

### Windows

1. Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
2. **Important:** Check **“Add Python to PATH”** during the installer.
3. Verify in your terminal: 
<CodeGroup>
```bash powershell
python --version
# → Python 3.12.x
```
</CodeGroup>

### macOS

Open your terminal and run the following to install python and verify the version

<CodeGroup>
```bash bash
brew install python@3.12
python3 -V
```
</CodeGroup>

### Linux
Most distros already ship a recent python version but if not run 

<CodeGroup>
```bash bash
sudo apt-get install python3.12 python3.12-venv
```
</CodeGroup>

## Step 2: Choose your Python package manager
You can either use pip or uv as your Python package manager. Pip is the classic package manager, uv is a newer, faster drop-in replacement for pip. We recommend using uv since it makes package management easier. 

### Installing uv (recommended)
Verify the [uv installation instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#installation-methods) for your machine on the astral website. You will likely run: 

<CodeGroup>
```bash curl
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
</CodeGroup>

Verify uv is installed correctly:
<CodeGroup>
```bash bash
uv --version
```
</CodeGroup>

### Using pip (alternative)
If you prefer to use pip, it should already be installed with Python. Verify it's working:

<CodeGroup>
```bash bash
pip --version
```
</CodeGroup>


## Step 3: Create a repository and / or project folder 
### Option A: With GitHub (Recommended)
If you have a GitHub account, create a repository and then clone it to your machine:

1. Create a repository on the GitHub website and fill in the appropriate details
2. Once created, you'll see a green "Code" button - click it
3. Click the "GitHub CLI" tab (assuming you set up the GitHub CLI) and copy the command
4. It will look like `gh repo clone YOUR_REPO_NAME`
5. Paste this into your terminal to clone the repository

<CodeGroup>
```bash gitrepo
gh repo clone YOUR_REPO_NAME
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
```
</CodeGroup>

### Option B: Local Folder Only
If you don't have a GitHub account, create a new project folder where we'll run the code samples:
<CodeGroup>
```bash bash
mkdir meshagent-getting-started
cd meshagent-getting-started
```
</CodeGroup>


## Step 4: Create your virtual environment
Virtual environments are important because they isolate your project dependencies from your system Python installation. This prevents version conflicts between different projects and keeps your system clean.

In your terminal, inside the project folder, run the following commands to create your virtual environment based on the package manager you are using:

<CodeGroup>
```bash uv
uv init # only run this the first time you are creating a project 
uv venv # create the virtual environment (only run the first time)
```
```bash pip
python -m venv .venv
```
</CodeGroup>

Now activate the virtual environment (you will do this every time you cd into the project folder where you're running your code)

<CodeGroup>
```bash macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```
```bash Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
</CodeGroup>

You'll know your virtual environment is active when you see ``.venv`` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

## Step 5: Install MeshAgent

Now that you have your virtual environment setup you can install MeshAgent! 

<CodeGroup>
```bash uv
uv add 'meshagent[all]' # use quotes since we are installing all of the packages
```
```bash pip
pip install 'meshagent[all]' # use quotes since we are installing all of the packages
```
</CodeGroup>

**Note**: Any shell that does glob-expansion (zsh, fish, PowerShell) treats the square brackets as a wildcard unless they’re quoted or back-escaped, this is why you need to put quotes around the ``meshagent[all]`` install command. Installing ``meshagent[all]`` is beneficial because you will get all of the python libraries associated with MeshAgent. If you are installing individual packages with Python you do not need to run the install command with quotes. For example, if you only wanted to install one of the MeshAgent libraries, like the MeshAgent CLI, you would run the command like this:

<CodeGroup>
```bash uv
uv add meshagent-cli
```
```bash pip
pip install meshagent-cli 
```
</CodeGroup>

**Note**: Inside an activated virtual-env pip already points to the right interpreter, so ``pip`` or ``pip3`` both work. Outside a venv you may need to run ``pip3`` to avoid Python 2 leftovers.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You now have everything set up to run the examples in the [Getting Started](../introduction/get_started) guide.

### Important Reminders
- Always activate your virtual environment before working on your project: 
<CodeGroup>
```bash macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```
```bash Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
</CodeGroup>

- If using uv, you can use ``uv run python your_script.py`` to automatically use the virtual environment. If your virtual environment is already activated you can also just run ``python your_script.py``.
- Keep your virtual environment activated while following the [Getting Started](../introduction/get_started) guide

### Troubleshooting Common Issues
- Python not found: Make sure Python was added to your PATH during installation (Windows) or use python3 instead of python (macOS/Linux).
- Permission errors: On macOS/Linux, you might need to restart your terminal after installing uv, or run source ~/.bashrc or source ~/.zshrc.
- Virtual environment not activating: Make sure you're in the correct project directory when running the activation commands.
