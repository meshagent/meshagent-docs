          argument-hint: "<content to review>"
          ---

          # Brand Review

          > If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

          Review marketing content against brand voice, style guidelines, and messaging standards. Flag deviations and provide specific improvement suggestions.

          ## Trigger

          User runs `/brand-review` or asks to review, check, or audit content against brand guidelines.

          ## Inputs

          1. **Content to review** — accept content in any of these forms:
            - Pasted directly into the conversation
            - A file path or knowledge base reference (e.g. Notion page, shared doc)
            - A URL to a published page
            - Multiple pieces for batch review

          2. **Brand guidelines source** (determined automatically):
            - If a brand style guide is configured in local settings, use it automatically
            - If not configured, ask: "Do you have a brand style guide or voice guidelines I should review against? You can paste them, share a file, or describe your brand voice. Otherwise, I'll do a general review for clarity, consistency, and professionalism."

          ## Review Process

          ### With Brand Guidelines Configured

          Evaluate the content against each of these dimensions:

          #### Voice and Tone
          - Does the content match the defined brand voice attributes?
          - Is the tone appropriate for the content type and audience?
          - Are there shifts in voice that feel inconsistent?
          - Flag specific sentences or phrases that deviate with an explanation of why

          #### Terminology and Language
          - Are preferred brand terms used correctly?
          - Are any "avoid" terms or phrases present?
          - Is jargon level appropriate for the target audience?
          - Are product names, feature names, and branded terms used correctly (capitalization, formatting)?

          #### Messaging Pillars
          - Does the content align with defined messaging pillars or value propositions?
          - Are claims consistent with approved messaging?
          - Is the content reinforcing or contradicting brand positioning?

          #### Style Guide Compliance
          - Grammar and punctuation per style guide (e.g., Oxford comma, title case vs. sentence case)
          - Formatting conventions (headers, lists, emphasis)
          - Number formatting, date formatting
          - Acronym usage (defined on first use?)

          ### Without Brand Guidelines (Generic Review)

          Evaluate the content for:

          #### Clarity
          - Is the main message clear within the first paragraph?
          - Are sentences concise and easy to understand?
          - Is the structure logical and easy to follow?
          - Are there ambiguous statements or unclear references?

          #### Consistency
          - Is the tone consistent throughout?
          - Are terms used consistently (no switching between synonyms for the same concept)?
          - Is formatting consistent (headers, lists, capitalization)?

          #### Professionalism
          - Is the content free of typos, grammatical errors, and awkward phrasing?
          - Is the tone appropriate for the intended audience?
          - Are claims supported or substantiated?

          ### Legal and Compliance Flags (Always Checked)

          Regardless of whether brand guidelines are configured, flag:
          - **Unsubstantiated claims** — superlatives ("best", "fastest", "only") without evidence or qualification
          - **Missing disclaimers** — financial claims, health claims, or guarantees that may need legal disclaimers
          - **Comparative claims** — comparisons to competitors that could be challenged
          - **Regulatory language** — content that may need compliance review (financial services, healthcare, etc.)
          - **Testimonial issues** — quotes or endorsements without attribution or disclosure
          - **Copyright concerns** — content that appears to be closely paraphrased from other sources

          ## Output Format

          Present the review as:

          ### Summary
          - Overall assessment: how well the content aligns with brand standards (or general quality)
          - 1-2 sentence summary of the biggest strengths
          - 1-2 sentence summary of the most important improvements

          ### Detailed Findings

          For each issue found, provide:

          | Issue | Location | Severity | Suggestion |
          |-------|----------|----------|------------|

          Where severity is:
          - **High** — contradicts brand voice, contains compliance risk, or significantly undermines messaging
          - **Medium** — inconsistent with guidelines but not damaging
          - **Low** — minor style or preference issue

          ### Revised Sections

          For the top 3-5 highest-severity issues, provide a before/after showing the original text and a suggested revision.

          ### Legal/Compliance Flags

          List any legal or compliance concerns separately with recommended actions.

          ## After Review

          Ask: "Would you like me to:
          - Revise the full content with these suggestions applied?
          - Focus on fixing just the high-severity issues?
          - Review additional content against the same guidelines?
          - Help you document your brand voice for future reviews?"

        - Challenge section
        - Solution section (what was implemented)
        - Results section with metrics (prompt user for data)
        - Customer quote placeholder
        - Call to action

        ## SEO Considerations (for web content)

        For blog posts, landing pages, and other web-facing content:
        - Suggest a primary keyword based on the topic
        - Recommend keyword placement: headline, first paragraph, subheadings, meta description
        - Suggest internal and external linking opportunities
        - Recommend a meta description (under 160 characters)
        - Note image alt text opportunities

        ## Output

        Present the draft with clear formatting. After the draft, include:
        - A brief note on what brand voice and tone were applied
        - Any SEO recommendations (for web content)
        - Suggestions for next steps (e.g., "Review with your team", "Add customer quotes", "Pair with a visual")

        Ask: "Would you like me to revise any section, adjust the tone, or create a variation for a different channel?"

        description: Design and draft multi-email sequences for nurture flows, onboarding, drip campaigns, and more
        argument-hint: "[sequence type]"
        ---

        # Email Sequence

        > If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

        Design and draft complete email sequences with full copy, timing, branching logic, and performance benchmarks for any lifecycle or campaign use case.

        ## Trigger

        User runs `/email-sequence` or asks to create, design, build, or draft an email sequence, drip campaign, nurture flow, or onboarding series.

        ## Inputs

        Gather the following from the user. If not provided, ask before proceeding:

        1. **Sequence type** — one of:
          - Onboarding
          - Lead nurture
          - Re-engagement
          - Product launch
          - Event follow-up
          - Upgrade/upsell
          - Win-back
          - Educational drip

        2. **Goal** — what the sequence should achieve (e.g., activate new users, convert leads to customers, reduce churn, drive event attendance, upsell to a higher tier)

        3. **Audience** — who receives this sequence, what stage they are at, and any relevant segmentation details (role, industry, behavior triggers, lifecycle stage)

        4. **Number of emails** (optional) — if not specified, recommend a count based on the sequence type using the templates in the Sequence Type Templates section below

        5. **Timing/cadence preferences** (optional) — desired spacing between emails (e.g., "every 3 days", "weekly", "aggressive first week then taper off")

        6. **Brand voice** — if configured in local settings, apply automatically and inform the user. If not configured, ask: "Do you have brand voice guidelines I should follow? If not, I'll use a clear, conversational professional tone."

        7. **Additional context** (optional):
          - Specific offers, discounts, or incentives to include
          - CTAs or landing pages to link to
          - Content assets available (blog posts, case studies, videos, guides)
          - Product features to highlight
          - Competitor differentiators to reference

        ## Process

        ### 1. Sequence Strategy

        Before drafting any emails, define the overall sequence architecture:

        - **Narrative arc** — what story does this sequence tell across all emails? What is the emotional and logical progression from first email to last?
        - **Journey mapping** — map each email to a stage of the buyer or user journey (awareness, consideration, decision, activation, expansion)
        - **Escalation logic** — how does the intensity, urgency, or value of each email build on the previous one?
        - **Success definition** — what specific action signals that the sequence has done its job and the recipient should exit?

        ### 2. Individual Email Design

        For each email in the sequence, produce:

        #### Subject Line
        - Provide 2-3 options per email
        - Vary approaches: curiosity, benefit-driven, urgency, personalization, question-based
        - Keep under 50 characters where possible; note preview behavior on mobile

        #### Preview Text
        - 40-90 characters that complement (not repeat) the subject line
        - Should add context or intrigue that increases open likelihood

        #### Email Purpose
        - One sentence explaining why this email exists and what it moves the recipient toward

        #### Body Copy
        - Full draft ready to use
        - Clear hierarchy: hook, body, CTA
        - Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
        - Scannable formatting with bold key phrases where appropriate
        - Personalization tokens where relevant (e.g., first name, company name, product used)

        #### Primary CTA
        - Button text and destination
        - One primary CTA per email (secondary CTA only if appropriate for the sequence stage)

        #### Timing
        - Days after the trigger event or after the previous email
        - Note if timing should adjust based on engagement (e.g., "send sooner if they opened but did not click")

        #### Segment/Condition Notes
        - Who receives this email vs. who skips it
        - Any behavioral or attribute-based conditions (e.g., "only send to users who have not completed setup")

        ### 3. Sequence Logic

        Define the flow control for the sequence:

        - **Branching conditions** — alternate paths based on engagement. For example:
          - "If opened email 2 but did not click CTA, send email 2b (softer re-ask) instead of email 3"
          - "If clicked CTA in email 1, skip email 2 and go directly to email 3"
        - **Exit conditions** — when a recipient converts (completes the desired action), remove them from the sequence. Define what "conversion" means for this sequence.
        - **Re-entry rules** — can someone re-enter the sequence? Under what conditions? (e.g., "if a user churns again 90 days later, re-enter the win-back sequence")
        - **Suppression rules** — do not send if the recipient is already in another active sequence, has unsubscribed from marketing, or has contacted support in the last 48 hours

        ### 4. Performance Benchmarks

        Provide expected benchmarks based on the sequence type so the user can set targets:

        | Metric | Onboarding | Lead Nurture | Re-engagement | Win-back |
        |--------|-----------|--------------|---------------|----------|
        | Open rate | 50-70% | 20-30% | 15-25% | 15-20% |
        | Click-through rate | 10-20% | 3-7% | 2-5% | 2-4% |
        | Conversion rate | 15-30% | 2-5% | 3-8% | 1-3% |
        | Unsubscribe rate | <0.5% | <0.5% | 1-2% | 1-3% |

        Adjust benchmarks based on industry and audience if the user has provided that context.

        ## Sequence Type Templates

        Use these as starting frameworks. Adapt length and content based on the user's goal and audience.

        **Onboarding (5-7 emails over 14-21 days):**
        Welcome and set expectations -- Quick win to demonstrate value -- Core feature deep dive -- Advanced feature or integration -- Social proof and community -- Check-in and feedback request -- Upgrade prompt or next steps

        **Lead Nurture (4-6 emails over 3-4 weeks):**
        Value-first educational content -- Pain point identification -- Solution positioning with proof -- Social proof and results -- Soft CTA (trial, demo, resource) -- Direct CTA (buy, book, sign up)

        **Re-engagement (3-4 emails over 10-14 days):**
        "We miss you" with a compelling reason to return -- Value reminder highlighting what they are missing -- Incentive or exclusive offer -- Last chance with clear deadline

        **Win-back (3-5 emails over 30 days):**
        Friendly check-in asking what went wrong -- What is new since they left -- Special offer or incentive to return -- Feedback request (even if they do not come back) -- Final goodbye with door open

        **Product Launch (4-6 emails over 2-3 weeks):**
        Teaser or pre-announcement -- Launch announcement with full details -- Feature spotlight or use case -- Social proof and early results -- Limited-time offer or bonus -- Last chance or reminder

        **Event Follow-up (3-4 emails over 7-10 days):**
        Thank you with key takeaways or recordings -- Resource roundup from the event -- Related offer or next step -- Feedback survey

        **Upgrade/Upsell (3-5 emails over 2-3 weeks):**
        Usage milestone or success celebration -- Feature gap or limitation they are hitting -- Upgrade benefits with proof -- Limited-time incentive -- Direct comparison of plans

        **Educational Drip (5-8 emails over 4-6 weeks):**
        Introduction and what they will learn -- Lesson 1: foundational concept -- Lesson 2: intermediate concept -- Lesson 3: advanced concept -- Practical application or exercise -- Resource roundup -- Graduation and next steps

        ## Tool Integration

        ### If email marketing is connected (e.g., Klaviyo, Mailchimp, Customer.io)
        - Reference how to set up the sequence as a flow or automation in the platform
        - Note any platform-specific features to use (e.g., smart send time, conditional splits, A/B testing)
        - Map the branching logic to the platform's visual flow builder concepts

        ### If marketing automation or CRM is connected (e.g., HubSpot, Marketo)
        - Reference lead scoring data to inform segmentation and exit conditions
        - Use lifecycle stage data to tailor messaging per segment
        - Note how to set enrollment triggers based on CRM properties or list membership

        ### If no tools are connected
        - Deliver all email content in copy-paste-ready format
        - Include a setup checklist the user can follow in any email platform:
          1. Create the automation or flow
          2. Set the enrollment trigger
          3. Add each email with the specified delays
          4. Configure branching and exit conditions
          5. Set up tracking for the recommended metrics

        ## Output

        Present the complete sequence with the following sections:

        ### Sequence Overview Table

        ### Branching Logic Notes
        Summary of all conditions, exits, and suppressions in a reference list.

        ### A/B Test Suggestions
        - 2-3 recommended A/B tests (subject lines, CTA text, send time, email length)
        - What to test, how to split, and how to measure the winner

        ### Metrics to Track
        - Primary conversion metric for the sequence
        - Per-email metrics: open rate, CTR, unsubscribe rate
        - Sequence-level metrics: overall conversion rate, time to conversion, drop-off points
        - Recommended review cadence (e.g., "Review performance weekly for the first month, then monthly")

        ## After the Sequence

        Ask: "Would you like me to:
        - Revise the copy or tone for any specific email?
        - Add a branching path for a specific scenario?
        - Create a variation of this sequence for a different audience segment?
        - Draft the A/B test variants for the subject lines?
        - Build a companion sequence (e.g., a post-purchase follow-up after this lead nurture converts)?"

        ---

        # /seo-audit

        > If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

        Audit a website's SEO health, research keyword opportunities, identify content gaps, and benchmark against competitors. Produces a prioritized action plan a marketer can execute immediately.

        ## Trigger

        User runs `/seo-audit` or asks for an SEO audit, keyword research, content gap analysis, technical SEO check, or competitor SEO comparison.

        ## Inputs

        Gather the following from the user. If not provided, ask before proceeding:

        1. **URL or domain** — the site to audit, or a topic/keyword if running in keyword research mode

        2. **Audit type** — one of:
          - **Full site audit** — end-to-end SEO review covering all sections below
          - **Keyword research** — identify keyword opportunities for a topic or domain
          - **Content gap analysis** — find topics competitors rank for that you don't
          - **Technical SEO check** — crawlability, speed, structured data, and infrastructure issues
          - **Competitor SEO comparison** — head-to-head SEO benchmarking against specific competitors

          If not specified, default to **full site audit**.

        3. **Target keywords or topics** (optional) — specific keywords the user is already targeting or wants to rank for

        4. **Competitors** (optional) — domains or companies to compare against. If not provided and the audit type requires competitor data, use web search to identify 2-3 likely competitors based on the user's domain and keyword space.

        ## Process

        ### 1. Keyword Research

        Research keywords related to the user's domain, topic, or target keywords.

        **If SEO tools are connected:**
        - Pull keyword data, search volume, keyword difficulty scores, and ranking positions automatically
        - Identify keywords the site currently ranks for and where it's gaining or losing ground

        **If product analytics are connected:**
        - Cross-reference keyword targets with actual organic traffic data to validate which keywords are driving visits and conversions

        **If tools are not connected:**
        - Use web search to research the keyword landscape
        - Note: "For more precise volume and difficulty data, connect an SEO tool like Ahrefs or Semrush via MCP. The audit will auto-populate with ranking data."

        For each keyword opportunity, assess:
        - **Primary keywords** — high-intent terms directly tied to the user's product or service
        - **Secondary keywords** — supporting terms and variations
        - **Search volume signals** — relative demand (high, medium, low) based on available data
        - **Keyword difficulty** — how competitive the term is (easy, moderate, hard)
        - **Long-tail opportunities** — specific, lower-competition phrases with clear intent
        - **Question-based keywords** — "how to", "what is", "why does" queries that mirror People Also Ask results
        - **Intent classification** — informational, navigational, commercial, or transactional

        ### 2. On-Page SEO Audit

        For each key page (homepage, top landing pages, recent blog posts), evaluate:

        - **Title tags** — present, unique, within 50-60 characters, includes target keyword
        - **Meta descriptions** — present, compelling, within 150-160 characters, includes a call to action
        - **H1 tags** — exactly one per page, includes primary keyword
        - **H2/H3 structure** — logical hierarchy, uses secondary keywords where natural
        - **Keyword usage** — primary keyword appears in the first 100 words, used naturally throughout, not over-stuffed
        - **Internal linking** — pages link to related content, orphan pages identified, anchor text is descriptive
        - **Image alt text** — all images have descriptive alt attributes, keywords included where relevant
        - **URL structure** — clean, readable, includes keywords, no excessive parameters or depth

        ### 3. Content Gap Analysis

        Identify what's missing from the user's content strategy:

        - **Competitor topic coverage** — topics and keywords competitors rank for that the user's site does not cover
        - **Content freshness** — pages that haven't been updated in 12+ months and may be losing rankings
        - **Thin content** — pages with insufficient depth to rank (under 300 words for informational queries, lacking substance)
        - **Missing content types** — formats competitors use that the user doesn't (guides, comparison pages, glossaries, tools, templates)
        - **Funnel gaps** — missing content at specific buyer journey stages (awareness, consideration, decision)
        - **Topic clusters** — opportunities to build pillar pages with supporting content

        ### 4. Technical SEO Checklist

        Evaluate technical foundations that affect crawlability and rankings:

        - **Page speed** — identify slow-loading pages and likely causes (large images, render-blocking scripts, excessive redirects)
        - **Mobile-friendliness** — responsive design, tap targets, font sizes, viewport configuration
        - **Structured data** — opportunities for schema markup (FAQ, HowTo, Product, Article, Organization, Breadcrumb)
        - **Crawlability** — robots.txt configuration, XML sitemap presence and accuracy, canonical tags, noindex/nofollow usage
        - **Broken links** — internal and external 404s, redirect chains
        - **HTTPS** — secure connection, mixed content issues
        - **Core Web Vitals signals** — LCP, FID/INP, CLS indicators based on observable page behavior
        - **Indexation** — pages that should be indexed but may not be, duplicate content risks

        ### 5. Competitor SEO Comparison

        For each competitor, compare:

        - **Keyword overlap** — keywords both sites rank for, and where each site ranks higher
        - **Keyword gaps** — terms the competitor ranks for that the user does not
        - **Domain authority signals** — relative site strength based on backlink profiles, referring domains, and content depth
        - **Content depth** — average content length, topic coverage breadth, publishing frequency
        - **Backlink profile observations** — types of sites linking to competitors, link-worthy content they've produced
        - **SERP feature ownership** — which competitor appears in featured snippets, People Also Ask, image packs, or knowledge panels
        - **Technical advantages** — site speed differences, mobile experience, structured data usage

        ## Output

        ### Executive Summary

        Open with a 3-5 sentence summary of overall SEO health. Highlight:
        - The site's biggest strength
        - The top 3 priorities that will have the most impact

        - **Topic or keyword** to target
        - **Why it matters** — search demand, competitor coverage, funnel stage
        - **Recommended format** — blog post, landing page, guide, comparison page, etc.
        - **Priority** — high, medium, or low
        - **Estimated effort** — quick win (1-2 hours), moderate (half day), substantial (multi-day)

        - Actions that take under 2 hours and have immediate impact
        - Examples: fix title tags, add meta descriptions, fix broken links, add alt text

        **Strategic Investments (plan for this quarter):**
        - Actions that require more effort but drive long-term growth
        - Examples: build a topic cluster, create a pillar page, launch a link-building campaign, overhaul site structure

        For each action item, include:
        - What to do (specific and concrete)
        - Expected impact (high, medium, low)
        - Effort estimate
        - Dependencies (if any)

        ## Follow-Up

        After presenting the audit, ask:

        "Would you like me to:
        - Draft content briefs for the top keyword opportunities?
        - Create optimized title tags and meta descriptions for your key pages?
        - Build a content calendar based on the gap analysis?
        - Dive deeper into any specific section of the audit?
        - Run this same analysis for a different competitor or domain?"

        # Brand Voice Skill

        Frameworks for documenting, applying, and enforcing brand voice and style guidelines across marketing content.

        ## Brand Voice Documentation Framework

        A complete brand voice document should cover these areas. Use this framework to help users define their brand voice or to understand an existing brand voice configuration.

        ### 1. Brand Personality
        Define the brand as if it were a person. What are its defining traits?

        Example: "If our brand were a person, they would be a knowledgeable colleague who explains complex things simply, celebrates your wins genuinely, and never talks down to you."

        ### 2. Voice Attributes
        Select 3-5 attributes that define how the brand communicates. Each attribute should be defined with:
        - What it means in practice
        - What it does NOT mean (to prevent misinterpretation)
        - An example demonstrating the attribute

        ### 3. Audience Awareness
        - Who the brand is speaking to (primary and secondary audiences)
        - What the audience cares about
        - What level of expertise the audience has
        - How the audience expects to be addressed

        ### 4. Core Messaging Pillars
        - 3-5 key themes the brand consistently communicates
        - The hierarchy of these messages (which comes first)
        - How each pillar connects to audience needs

        ### 5. Tone Spectrum
        How the voice adapts across contexts while remaining recognizably the same brand.

        ### 6. Style Rules
        Specific grammar, formatting, and language rules. See the Style Guide Enforcement section below.

        ### 7. Terminology
        Preferred and avoided terms. See the Terminology Management section below.

        ## Voice Attributes

        ### Common Voice Attribute Pairs

        When defining brand voice, it helps to position attributes on a spectrum. Here are common attribute spectrums:

        | Spectrum | One End | Other End |
        |----------|---------|-----------|
        | Formality | Formal, institutional | Casual, conversational |
        | Authority | Expert, authoritative | Peer-level, collaborative |
        | Emotion | Warm, empathetic | Direct, matter-of-fact |
        | Complexity | Technical, precise | Simple, accessible |
        | Energy | Bold, energetic | Calm, measured |
        | Humor | Playful, witty | Serious, earnest |
        | Innovation | Cutting-edge, forward-looking | Established, proven |

        ### Defining an Attribute

        For each chosen attribute, document it in this format:

        **[Attribute name]**
        - **We are**: [what this means in practice]
        - **We are not**: [common misinterpretation to avoid]
        - **This sounds like**: [example sentence demonstrating the attribute]
        - **This does NOT sound like**: [example sentence violating the attribute]

        Example:

        **Approachable**
        - **We are**: friendly, clear, jargon-free, welcoming to beginners and experts alike
        - **We are not**: dumbed-down, overly casual, or lacking substance
        - **This sounds like**: "Here's how to get started — it takes about five minutes."
        - **This does NOT sound like**: "Yo! This is super easy, even a noob can do it lol."

        ## Tone Adaptation Across Channels and Contexts

        The brand voice stays consistent, but tone adapts to context. Tone is the emotional inflection applied to the voice.

        ### Tone by Channel

        | Channel | Tone Adaptation | Example |
        |---------|----------------|---------|
        | Blog | Informative, conversational, educational | "Let's walk through how this works and why it matters for your team." |
        | Social media (LinkedIn) | Professional, thought-provoking, concise | "Three things we learned from running 50 campaigns this quarter." |
        | Social media (Twitter/X) | Punchy, direct, sometimes witty | "Your landing page has 3 seconds. Make them count." |
        | Email marketing | Personal, helpful, action-oriented | "We put together something we think you'll find useful." |
        | Sales collateral | Confident, benefit-driven, specific | "Teams using our platform reduce reporting time by 40%." |
        | Support/Help docs | Clear, patient, step-by-step | "If you see this error, here's how to fix it." |
        | Press release | Formal, factual, newsworthy | "The company today announced the launch of..." |
        | Error messages | Empathetic, helpful, blame-free | "Something went wrong on our end. We're looking into it." |

        ### Tone by Situation

        | Situation | Tone Adaptation |
        |-----------|----------------|
        | Product launch | Excited, confident, forward-looking |
        | Incident or outage | Transparent, empathetic, accountable |
        | Customer success story | Celebratory, specific, crediting the customer |
        | Thought leadership | Authoritative, nuanced, evidence-based |
        | Onboarding | Welcoming, encouraging, clear |
        | Bad news (price increase, deprecation) | Honest, respectful, solution-oriented |
        | Competitive comparison | Confident but fair, fact-based, not disparaging |

        ### Tone Adaptation Rule
        The voice attributes remain fixed. Tone dials them up or down based on context. For example, if a brand is "bold and warm":
        - In a product launch, dial up boldness
        - In an incident response, dial up warmth
        - Neither attribute disappears; the balance shifts

        ## Style Guide Enforcement

        ### Grammar and Mechanics
        Document and enforce these choices consistently:

        | Rule | Options | Example |
        |------|---------|---------|
        | Oxford comma | Yes / No | "fast, reliable, and secure" vs. "fast, reliable and secure" |
        | Sentence case vs. title case (headings) | Sentence / Title | "How to get started" vs. "How to Get Started" |
        | Contractions | Use / Avoid | "we're" vs. "we are" |
        | Em dash spacing | No spaces / Spaces | "this—and more" vs. "this — and more" |
        | Numbers | Spell out 1-9, numerals 10+ / Always numerals | "five features" vs. "5 features" |
        | Percent | % / percent | "50%" vs. "50 percent" |
        | Date format | Month DD, YYYY / DD/MM/YYYY / etc. | "January 15, 2025" |
        | Time format | 12-hour / 24-hour | "3:00 PM" vs. "15:00" |
        | Lists | Periods / No periods on fragments | "Set up your account." vs. "Set up your account" |

        ### Formatting Conventions
        - Heading hierarchy (when to use H1, H2, H3)
        - Bold and italic usage (bold for emphasis, italic for titles/terms)
        - Link text (descriptive vs. "click here" — always descriptive)
        - Image alt text requirements
        - Code formatting (for technical brands)
        - Callout or highlight box usage

        ### Punctuation and Emphasis
        - Exclamation mark policy (limited use, never more than one)
        - Ellipsis usage (avoid in most professional contexts)
        - ALL CAPS policy (avoid; use bold for emphasis instead)
        - Emoji usage by channel (professional channels: minimal or none; social: where appropriate)

        ## Terminology Management

        ### Preferred Terms

        Maintain a list of preferred terms and their incorrect alternatives:

        | Use This | Not This | Notes |
        |----------|----------|-------|
        | sign up (verb) | signup (verb) | "signup" is the noun form |
        | log in (verb) | login (verb) | "login" is the noun/adjective form |
        | set up (verb) | setup (verb) | "setup" is the noun/adjective form |
        | email | e-mail | No hyphen |
        | website | web site | One word |
        | data is (singular) | data are | Unless the publication requires plural |

        ### Product and Feature Names
        - Official capitalization for product names
        - When to use the full product name vs. shorthand
        - Whether to use "the" before product names
        - How to handle versioning in copy
        - Trademark and registration symbols (when required and when to omit)

        ### Inclusive Language
        - Use gender-neutral language (they/them for unknown individuals)
        - Avoid ableist language ("crazy", "blind spot", "lame")
        - Use person-first language where appropriate
        - Avoid culturally specific idioms that may not translate
        - Use "simple" or "straightforward" instead of "easy" (what is easy varies by person)

        ### Industry Jargon Management
        - Define which technical terms the audience understands without explanation
        - List jargon that should always be defined or replaced with plain language
        - Specify which acronyms need to be spelled out on first use
        - Audience-specific glossary for terms that mean different things to different readers

        ### Competitor and Category Terms
        - How to refer to your product category (use your preferred framing)
        - How to refer to competitors (by name or generically)
        - Terms competitors have coined that you should avoid (to prevent reinforcing their positioning)
        - Your preferred differentiation language

        # Campaign Planning Skill

        Frameworks and guidance for planning, structuring, and executing marketing campaigns.

        ## Campaign Framework: Objective, Audience, Message, Channel, Measure

        Every campaign should be built on this five-part framework:

        ### 1. Objective
        Define what success looks like before planning anything else.

        - **Awareness**: increase brand or product visibility (measured by reach, impressions, share of voice)
        - **Consideration**: drive engagement and education (measured by content engagement, email signups, webinar attendance)
        - **Conversion**: generate leads or sales (measured by signups, demos, purchases, pipeline)
        - **Retention**: re-engage existing customers (measured by churn reduction, upsell, NPS)
        - **Advocacy**: turn customers into promoters (measured by referrals, reviews, UGC)

        Good objectives are SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.

        Example: "Generate 200 marketing qualified leads from mid-market SaaS companies in North America within 6 weeks of campaign launch."

        ### 2. Audience
        Define who you are trying to reach with enough specificity to guide messaging and channel decisions.

        - **Demographics**: role/title, seniority, company size, industry
        - **Psychographics**: motivations, pain points, goals, objections
        - **Behavioral**: where they consume content, how they buy, what they have engaged with before
        - **Buying stage**: are they unaware of the problem, researching solutions, or ready to buy?

        Create a brief audience profile (not a full persona) for campaign planning:
        > "[Role] at [company type] who is struggling with [pain point] and looking for [desired outcome]. They typically discover solutions through [channels] and care most about [priorities]."

        ### 3. Message
        Craft the core message and supporting points that will resonate with the audience.

        - **Core message**: one sentence that captures what you want the audience to think, feel, or do
        - **Supporting messages**: 3-4 points that provide evidence, address objections, or elaborate on benefits
        - **Proof points**: data, case studies, testimonials, or third-party validation for each supporting message
        - **Differentiation**: what makes your offering different from alternatives (including doing nothing)

        Message hierarchy:
        1. Why should I care? (addresses the pain point or opportunity)
        2. What is the solution? (positions your offering)
        3. Why you? (differentiates from alternatives)
        4. What should I do? (call to action)

        ### 4. Channel
        Select channels based on where your audience is, not where you are most comfortable.

        See the Channel Selection Guide below for detailed guidance.

        ### 5. Measure
        Define how you will know the campaign worked. See Success Metrics by Campaign Type below.

        ## Channel Selection Guide

        ### Owned Channels

        | Channel | Best For | Typical Metrics | Effort |
        |---------|----------|----------------|--------|
        | Blog/Website | SEO, thought leadership, education | Traffic, time on page, conversions | Medium |
        | Email | Nurture, retention, announcements | Open rate, CTR, conversions | Low-Medium |
        | Social (organic) | Awareness, community, brand building | Engagement, reach, follower growth | Medium |
        | Webinars | Education, lead gen, product demos | Registrations, attendance, pipeline | High |
        | Podcast | Thought leadership, brand awareness | Downloads, subscriber growth | High |

        ### Earned Channels

        | Channel | Best For | Typical Metrics | Effort |
        |---------|----------|----------------|--------|

        | Influencer/Partner | Audience expansion, trust | Reach, engagement, referral conversions | Medium-High |
        | Community | Awareness, trust, feedback | Mentions, engagement, referral traffic | Medium |
        | Reviews/Ratings | Credibility, SEO, consideration | Review volume, rating, conversion lift | Low-Medium |

        ### Paid Channels

        | Channel | Best For | Typical Metrics | Effort |
        |---------|----------|----------------|--------|
        | Search ads (SEM) | High-intent lead capture | CPC, CTR, conversion rate, CPA | Medium |
        | Social ads | Awareness, retargeting, lead gen | CPM, CPC, CTR, CPA, ROAS | Medium |
        | Display/Programmatic | Awareness, retargeting | Impressions, CPM, view-through conversions | Low-Medium |
        | Sponsored content | Thought leadership, lead gen | Engagement, leads, cost per lead | Medium |
        | Events/Sponsorships | Relationship building, brand | Leads, meetings, pipeline influenced | High |

        ### Channel Selection Criteria
        When choosing channels, consider:
        - Where does your target audience spend time?
        - What is the buying stage you are targeting? (awareness channels vs. conversion channels)
        - What is your budget? (paid channels require spend; owned/earned require time)
        - What content assets do you already have or can you produce?
        - What has worked in the past? (reference historical data if available)

        ## Content Calendar Creation

        ### Calendar Structure

        A content calendar should answer: what, where, when, who, and why for every piece of content.

        | Date | Content Piece | Channel | Audience Segment | Campaign/Theme | Owner | Status |
        |------|--------------|---------|-------------------|----------------|-------|--------|

        ### Calendar Planning Process
        1. **Start with milestones**: campaign launch, event dates, product releases, seasonal moments
        2. **Work backward**: what needs to be live and when? What is the production lead time?
        3. **Map content to funnel stages**: ensure coverage across awareness, consideration, and conversion
        4. **Batch by theme**: group related content pieces into weekly or bi-weekly themes
        5. **Balance channels**: do not over-index on one channel; ensure the audience sees the campaign across touchpoints
        6. **Build in flexibility**: leave 20% of calendar slots open for reactive or opportunistic content

        ### Content Cadence Guidelines
        - **Blog**: 1-4 posts per week depending on team size and goals
        - **Email newsletter**: weekly or bi-weekly for most audiences
        - **Social media**: 3-7 posts per week per platform (varies by platform)
        - **Paid campaigns**: continuous during campaign window with creative refreshes every 2-4 weeks
        - **Webinars**: monthly or quarterly depending on resources

        ### Production Timeline Benchmarks
        - Blog post: 3-5 business days (research, draft, review, publish)
        - Email campaign: 2-3 business days (copy, design, test, send)
        - Social media posts: 1-2 business days (draft, design, schedule)
        - Landing page: 5-7 business days (copy, design, development, QA)
        - Video content: 2-4 weeks (script, production, editing)
        - Ebook/whitepaper: 2-4 weeks (outline, draft, design, review)

        ## Budget Allocation Approaches

        ### Percentage of Revenue Method
        - Industry benchmark: 5-15% of revenue for marketing, with B2B typically at 5-10% and B2C at 10-15%
        - Startups and growth-stage companies often invest 15-25% of revenue in marketing
        - Within the marketing budget, allocate across brand (long-term) and performance (short-term)

        ### Channel Allocation Framework
        A common starting framework (adjust based on goals and historical data):

        | Category | Percentage of Budget | Examples |
        |----------|---------------------|----------|
        | Paid acquisition | 30-40% | Search ads, social ads, display |
        | Content production | 20-30% | Blog, video, design, ebooks |
        | Events and sponsorships | 10-20% | Conferences, webinars, meetups |
        | Tools and technology | 10-15% | Analytics, automation, CRM |
        | Testing and experimentation | 5-10% | New channels, A/B tests, pilots |

        ### Budget Optimization Principles
        - Start with your highest-confidence channel and allocate 60-70% of paid budget there
        - Reserve 15-20% for testing new channels or tactics
        - Shift budget monthly based on performance data (do not set and forget)
        - Account for production costs, not just media spend
        - Include a 10-15% contingency for unexpected opportunities or overruns

        # Competitive Analysis Skill

        Frameworks and methodologies for researching competitors, comparing positioning, and identifying market opportunities.

        ## Competitive Research Methodology

        ### Research Sources

        Gather intelligence from these categories of sources:

        #### Primary Sources (Direct from Competitor)
        - **Website**: homepage, product pages, pricing, about page, careers
        - **Blog and resource center**: content themes, publishing frequency, depth
        - **Social media profiles**: messaging, engagement, content strategy
        - **Product demos and free trials**: UX, features, onboarding experience
        - **Webinars and events**: topics, speakers, audience engagement
        - **Press releases and newsroom**: announcements, partnerships, milestones
        - **Job postings**: hiring signals that reveal strategic priorities (e.g., hiring for a new product line or market)

        #### Secondary Sources (Third-Party)
        - **Review sites**: G2, Capterra, TrustRadius, Product Hunt — customer sentiment themes
        - **Analyst reports**: Gartner, Forrester, IDC — market positioning and category placement
        - **News coverage**: TechCrunch, industry publications — funding, partnerships, narrative
        - **Social listening**: mentions, sentiment, share of voice across social platforms
        - **SEO tools**: keyword rankings, organic traffic estimates, content gaps
        - **Financial filings**: revenue, growth rate, investment areas (for public companies)
        - **Community forums**: community forums (e.g. Reddit, Discourse), industry chat groups (e.g. Slack communities) — user sentiment

        ### Research Process
        1. **Set scope**: define which competitors and what aspects to analyze
        2. **Gather data**: systematically collect information from sources above
        3. **Organize findings**: structure by competitor, then by dimension
        4. **Analyze patterns**: identify themes, strengths, weaknesses, and trends
        5. **Compare to your position**: map findings against your own positioning and capabilities
        6. **Synthesize insights**: extract actionable takeaways and opportunities
        7. **Date-stamp everything**: competitive intelligence has a short shelf life

        ### Research Cadence
        - **Deep competitive analysis**: quarterly (full research across all sources)
        - **Competitive monitoring**: monthly (scan for new announcements, content, messaging changes)
        - **Real-time alerts**: ongoing (set up alerts for competitor brand mentions, press, job postings)

        ## Messaging Comparison Frameworks

        ### Messaging Matrix

        Compare messaging across competitors on key dimensions:

        | Dimension | Your Company | Competitor A | Competitor B | Competitor C |
        |-----------|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
        | Tagline/Headline | | | | |
        | Core value proposition | | | | |
        | Primary audience | | | | |
        | Key differentiator claim | | | | |
        | Tone/Voice | | | | |
        | Proof points used | | | | |
        | Category framing | | | | |
        | Primary CTA | | | | |

        ### Value Proposition Comparison

        For each competitor, document:
        - **Promise**: what they promise the customer will achieve
        - **Evidence**: how they prove the promise (data, testimonials, demos)
        - **Mechanism**: how their product delivers on the promise (the "how it works")
        - **Uniqueness**: what they claim only they can do

        ### Narrative Analysis

        Identify each competitor's story arc:
        - **Villain**: what problem or enemy they position against (status quo, legacy tools, complexity)
        - **Hero**: who is the hero in their story (the customer? the product? the team?)
        - **Transformation**: what before/after do they promise?
        - **Stakes**: what happens if you do not act?

        This reveals positioning strategy and emotional appeals.

        ### Messaging Strengths and Vulnerabilities

        For each competitor's messaging, assess:
        - **Clarity**: can a first-time visitor understand what they do in 5 seconds?
        - **Differentiation**: is their positioning distinct or generic?
        - **Proof**: do they back up claims with evidence?
        - **Consistency**: is messaging consistent across channels?
        - **Resonance**: does their messaging address real customer pain points?

        ## Content Gap Analysis

        ### Content Audit Comparison

        Map content across competitors by:

        | Topic/Theme | Your Content | Competitor A | Competitor B | Gap? |
        |-------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|------|
        | [Topic 1] | Blog post, ebook | Blog series, webinar | Nothing | Opportunity for B |
        | [Topic 2] | Nothing | Whitepaper | Blog post, video | Gap for you |
        | [Topic 3] | Case study | Nothing | Case study | Parity |

        ### Content Type Coverage

        | Content Format | You | Comp A | Comp B | Comp C |
        |----------------|-----|--------|--------|--------|
        | Blog posts | Y | Y | Y | Y |
        | Case studies | Y | Y | N | Y |
        | Ebooks/Whitepapers | N | Y | Y | N |
        | Webinars | Y | Y | Y | N |
        | Podcast | N | N | Y | N |
        | Video content | N | Y | Y | Y |
        | Interactive tools | N | N | N | Y |
        | Templates/Resources | Y | N | Y | N |

        ### Identifying Content Opportunities
        1. **Topics they cover that you do not**: potential gaps in your content strategy
        2. **Topics you cover that they do not**: potential differentiators to amplify
        3. **Formats they use that you do not**: format gaps that could reach new audiences
        4. **Audience segments they address that you do not**: underserved audiences
        5. **Search terms they rank for that you do not**: SEO content gaps

        ### Content Quality Assessment
        - Depth: surface-level or comprehensive?
        - Freshness: regularly updated or stale?
        - Engagement: do posts get comments, shares, links?
        - Production value: text-only or multimedia?
        - Thought leadership: original insights or rehashed content?

        ## Positioning Strategy

        ### Positioning Statement Framework

        For your company and each competitor, define (or reverse-engineer) their positioning statement:

        > For [target audience], [product/company] is the [category] that [key benefit/differentiator] because [reason to believe].

        Example:
        > For mid-market SaaS marketing teams, Acme is the campaign management platform that unifies planning and execution in one workspace because it is built on a single data model that eliminates tool fragmentation.

        ### Positioning Map

        Plot competitors on a 2x2 matrix using the two most important dimensions for your market:

        Common axis pairs:
        - **Price vs. Capability** (low cost / basic vs. premium / full-featured)
        - **Ease of Use vs. Power** (simple / limited vs. complex / flexible)
        - **SMB Focus vs. Enterprise Focus** (self-serve / individual vs. sales-led / team)
        - **Point Solution vs. Platform** (does one thing well vs. does many things)
        - **Innovative vs. Established** (new approach vs. proven track record)

        Identify which quadrant is underserved or where your differentiation is strongest.

        ### Category Strategy
        - **Create a new category**: if you do something genuinely different, define and own the category (high risk, high reward)
        - **Reframe the existing category**: change how buyers evaluate the category to favor your strengths
        - **Win the existing category**: compete directly on recognized criteria and out-execute
        - **Niche within the category**: own a specific segment, use case, or audience

        ### Positioning Pitfalls to Avoid
        - Positioning against a competitor rather than for a customer need
        - Claiming too many differentiators (pick 1-2 that matter most)
        - Using category jargon the customer does not use
        - Positioning on features rather than outcomes
        - Changing positioning too frequently (confuses the market)

        ## Battlecard Creation

        ### Battlecard Structure

        A competitive battlecard is a one-page reference for sales and marketing teams. Include:

        #### Header
        - Competitor name and logo
        - Last updated date
        - Competitive win rate (if tracked)

        #### Quick Overview
        - What they do (one sentence)
        - Their target customer
        - Pricing model summary
        - Key recent developments

        #### Their Pitch
        - How they describe themselves
        - Their primary tagline
        - Their top 3 claimed differentiators

        #### Strengths (Be Honest)
        - Where they genuinely compete well
        - What customers like about them (from reviews)
        - Features or capabilities where they lead

        #### Weaknesses
        - Consistent customer complaints (from reviews)
        - Technical limitations
        - Gaps in their offering
        - Areas where customers report dissatisfaction

        #### Our Differentiators
        - 3-5 specific ways your product or approach is different
        - For each: the differentiator, why it matters to the customer, and proof

        #### Objection Handling
        | If the prospect says... | Respond with... |
        |------------------------|----------------|
        | "[Competitor] does X too" | "Here is how our approach differs..." |
        | "[Competitor] is cheaper" | "Here is what that price difference gets you..." |
        | "I've heard good things about [Competitor]" | "They are strong at X. Where we differ is..." |

        #### Landmines to Set
        Questions to ask prospects early that highlight your advantages:
        - "How do you currently handle [area where competitor is weak]?"
        - "How important is [capability you have that they lack]?"
        - "Have you considered [risk that your product mitigates]?"

        #### Landmines to Defuse
        Questions competitors might encourage prospects to ask you, with prepared responses.

        #### Win/Loss Themes
        - Common reasons deals are won against this competitor
        - Common reasons deals are lost to this competitor
        - What types of prospects favor them vs. you

        ### Battlecard Maintenance
        - Review and update quarterly at minimum
        - Update immediately after major competitor announcements
        - Incorporate win/loss feedback from sales team
        - Track which objection-handling responses are most effective

        # Content Creation Skill

        Guidelines and frameworks for creating effective marketing content across channels.

        ## Content Type Templates

        ### Blog Post Structure
        1. **Headline** — clear, benefit-driven, includes primary keyword (aim for 60 characters or less for SEO)
        2. **Introduction** (100-150 words) — hook the reader with a question, statistic, bold claim, or relatable scenario. State what the post will cover. Include primary keyword.
        3. **Body sections** (3-5 sections) — each with a descriptive subheading (H2). Use H3 for subsections. One core idea per section with supporting evidence, examples, or data.
        4. **Conclusion** (75-100 words) — summarize key takeaways, reinforce the main message, include a call to action.
        5. **Meta description** — under 160 characters, includes primary keyword, compels the click.

        ### Social Media Post Structure
        - **Hook** — first line grabs attention (question, bold statement, number)
        - **Body** — 2-4 concise points or a short narrative
        - **CTA** — what should the reader do next (comment, click, share, tag)
        - **Hashtags** — 3-5 relevant hashtags (platform-dependent)

        ### Email Newsletter Structure
        - **Subject line** — under 50 characters, creates curiosity or states clear value
        - **Preview text** — complements the subject line, does not repeat it
        - **Header/hero** — visual anchor and one-line value statement
        - **Body sections** — 2-3 content blocks, each scannable with a bold intro sentence
        - **Primary CTA** — one clear action per email
        - **Footer** — unsubscribe link, company info, social links

        ### Landing Page Structure
        - **Headline** — primary benefit in under 10 words
        - **Subheadline** — elaborates on the headline with supporting context
        - **Hero section** — headline, subheadline, primary CTA, supporting image or video
        - **Value propositions** — 3-4 benefit-driven sections with icons or images
        - **Social proof** — testimonials, logos, stats, case study snippets
        - **Objection handling** — FAQ or trust signals
        - **Final CTA** — repeat the primary call to action

        ### Press Release Structure
        - **Headline** — factual, newsworthy, under 80 characters
        - **Subheadline** — optional, adds context
        - **Dateline** — city, state, date
        - **Lead paragraph** — who, what, when, where, why in 2-3 sentences
        - **Body paragraphs** — supporting details, quotes, context
        - **Boilerplate** — company description (standardized)
        - **Media contact** — name, email, phone

        ### Case Study Structure
        - **Title** — "[Customer] achieves [result] with [product]"
        - **Snapshot** — customer name, industry, company size, product used, key result (sidebar or callout box)
        - **Challenge** — what problem the customer faced
        - **Solution** — what was implemented and how
        - **Results** — quantified outcomes with specific metrics
        - **Quote** — customer testimonial
        - **CTA** — learn more, get a demo, read more case studies

        ## Writing Best Practices by Channel

        ### Blog
        - Write at an 8th-grade reading level for broad audiences; adjust up for technical audiences
        - Use short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
        - Include subheadings every 200-300 words
        - Use bullet points and numbered lists to break up text
        - Include at least one data point, example, or quote per section
        - Write in active voice
        - Front-load key information in each section

        ### Social Media
        - **LinkedIn**: professional but human, paragraph breaks for readability, personal stories and lessons perform well, 1,300 characters is the sweet spot before "see more"
        - **Twitter/X**: concise and punchy, strong opening words, threads for longer narratives, engage with replies
        - **Instagram**: visual-first captions, storytelling hooks, line breaks for readability, hashtags in first comment or at end
        - **Facebook**: conversational tone, questions drive comments, shorter posts (under 80 characters) get more engagement for links

        ### Email
        - Write subject lines that create urgency, curiosity, or state clear value
        - Personalize where possible (name, company, behavior)
        - One primary CTA per email — make it visually distinct
        - Keep body copy scannable: bold key phrases, short paragraphs, bullet points
        - Test everything: subject lines, send times, CTA copy, layout
        - Mobile-first: most email is read on mobile

        ### Web (Landing Pages, Product Pages)
        - Lead with benefits, not features
        - Use "you" language — speak to the reader directly
        - Minimize jargon unless the audience expects it
        - Every section should answer "so what?" from the reader's perspective
        - Reduce friction: fewer form fields, clear next steps, trust signals near CTAs

        ## SEO Fundamentals for Content

        ### Keyword Strategy
        - Identify one primary keyword and 2-3 secondary keywords per piece
        - Use the primary keyword in: headline, first paragraph, one subheading, meta description, URL slug
        - Use secondary keywords naturally in body copy and subheadings
        - Do not keyword-stuff — write for humans first

        ### On-Page SEO Checklist
        - Title tag: under 60 characters, includes primary keyword
        - Meta description: under 160 characters, includes primary keyword, compels click
        - URL slug: short, descriptive, includes primary keyword
        - H1: one per page, matches or closely reflects the title tag
        - H2/H3: descriptive, include secondary keywords where natural
        - Image alt text: descriptive, includes keyword where relevant
        - Internal links: 2-3 links to related content on your site
        - External links: 1-2 links to authoritative sources

        ### Content-SEO Integration
        - Aim for comprehensive coverage of the topic (search engines reward depth)
        - Answer related questions (check "People Also Ask" for ideas)
        - Update and refresh high-performing content regularly
        - Structure content for featured snippets: definition paragraphs, numbered lists, tables

        ## Headline and Hook Formulas

        ### Headline Formulas

        - **The [adjective] guide to [topic]** — "The Complete Guide to B2B Content Marketing"
        - **[Do this], not [that]** — "Build a Community, Not Just an Audience"
        - **What [impressive result] taught us about [topic]** — "What 10,000 A/B Tests Taught Us About Email Subject Lines"
        - **[topic]: what [audience] needs to know in [year]** — "SEO: What Marketers Need to Know in 2025"

        ### Hook Formulas (Opening Lines)
        - **Surprising statistic**: "73% of marketers say their biggest challenge is not budget — it is focus."
        - **Contrarian statement**: "The best marketing campaigns start with saying no to most channels."
        - **Question**: "When was the last time a marketing email actually changed what you bought?"
        - **Scenario**: "Imagine launching a campaign and knowing, before it goes live, which messages will land."
        - **Bold claim**: "Most landing pages lose half their visitors in the first three seconds."
        - **Story opening**: "Last quarter, our team was spending 20 hours a week on reporting. Here is what we did about it."

        ## Call-to-Action Best Practices

        ### CTA Principles
        - Use action verbs: "Get", "Start", "Download", "Join", "Try", "See"
        - Be specific about what happens next: "Start your free trial" is better than "Submit"
        - Create urgency when genuine: "Join 500 teams already using this" or "Limited spots available"
        - Reduce risk: "No credit card required", "Cancel anytime", "Free for 14 days"
        - One primary CTA per page or email — too many choices reduce conversions

        ### CTA Examples by Context
        - **Blog post**: "Read our complete guide to [topic]" / "Subscribe for weekly insights"
        - **Landing page**: "Start free trial" / "Get a demo" / "See pricing"
        - **Email**: "Read the full story" / "Claim your spot" / "Reply and tell us"
        - **Social media**: "Drop a comment if you agree" / "Save this for later" / "Link in bio"
        - **Case study**: "See how [product] can work for your team" / "Talk to our team"

        ### CTA Placement
        - Above the fold on landing pages (do not make users scroll to act)
        - After establishing value in emails (not in the first sentence)
        - At the end of blog posts (after you have earned the reader's trust)
        - In-line within content when contextually relevant (e.g., a related guide mention)
        - Repeat the primary CTA at the bottom of long-form pages

        1. Executive summary (3-5 sentences)
        2. Key metrics dashboard (table with MoM and target comparison)
        3. Channel-by-channel performance summary
        4. Campaign highlights and results
        5. What worked and what did not (with hypotheses)

        ### Dashboard Design Principles
        - Lead with the metrics that map to business objectives (not vanity metrics)
        - Show trends over time, not just point-in-time snapshots
        - Include comparison context: prior period, target, benchmark
        - Use consistent color coding: green (on track), yellow (at risk), red (off track)
        - Group metrics by funnel stage or business question
        - Keep dashboards to one page/screen — detail goes in appendix
        - Update cadence should match decision cadence (real-time for paid, weekly for content)

        ## Trend Analysis and Forecasting

        ### Trend Identification
        When analyzing performance data, look for:

        1. **Directional trends**: is the metric consistently going up, down, or flat over 4+ periods?
        2. **Inflection points**: where did performance change direction and what happened then?
        3. **Seasonality**: are there predictable patterns by day of week, month, or quarter?
        4. **Anomalies**: one-time spikes or drops — what caused them and are they repeatable?
        5. **Leading indicators**: which metrics change first and predict future outcomes?

        ### Trend Analysis Process
        1. Chart the metric over time (at least 8-12 data points for meaningful trends)
        2. Identify the overall direction (upward, downward, flat, cyclical)
        3. Calculate the rate of change (is it accelerating or decelerating?)
        4. Overlay key events (campaigns launched, product changes, market events)
        5. Compare to benchmarks or targets
        6. Identify correlations with other metrics
        7. Form hypotheses about causation (and plan tests to validate)

        ### Simple Forecasting Approaches
        - **Linear projection**: extend the current trend line forward (useful for stable metrics)
        - **Moving average**: smooth out noise by averaging the last 3-6 periods
        - **Year-over-year comparison**: use last year's pattern as a baseline, adjusted for growth rate
        - **Funnel math**: forecast outputs from inputs (e.g., if we generate X leads at Y conversion rate, we will get Z customers)
        - **Scenario modeling**: create best case, expected case, and worst case projections

        ### Forecasting Caveats
        - Short-term forecasts (1-3 months) are more reliable than long-term
        - Forecasts based on fewer than 12 data points should be flagged as low confidence
        - External factors (market shifts, competitive moves, economic changes) can invalidate trend-based forecasts
        - Always present forecasts as ranges, not exact numbers

        ## Attribution Modeling Basics

        ### What Is Attribution?
        Attribution determines which marketing touchpoints get credit for a conversion. This matters because buyers typically interact with multiple channels before converting.

        ### Common Attribution Models

        | Model | How It Works | Best For | Limitation |
        |-------|-------------|----------|------------|
        | Last touch | 100% credit to last interaction before conversion | Understanding final conversion triggers | Ignores awareness and nurture |
        | First touch | 100% credit to first interaction | Understanding top-of-funnel effectiveness | Ignores nurture and conversion drivers |
        | Linear | Equal credit to all touchpoints | Fair representation of all channels | Does not reflect relative impact |
        | Time decay | More credit to touchpoints closer to conversion | Balanced view favoring recent interactions | May undervalue awareness |
        | Position-based (U-shaped) | 40% first, 40% last, 20% split among middle | Valuing both discovery and conversion | Somewhat arbitrary weighting |
        | Data-driven | Algorithmic credit based on conversion patterns | Most accurate representation | Requires significant data volume |

        ### Attribution Practical Guidance
        - Start with last-touch attribution if you have no model in place — it is the simplest and most actionable
        - Compare first-touch and last-touch to understand which channels drive awareness vs. conversion
        - Use position-based (U-shaped) as a reasonable middle ground for most B2B companies
        - Data-driven attribution requires high conversion volume to be statistically meaningful
        - No model is perfect — use attribution directionally, not as absolute truth
        - Multi-touch attribution is better than single-touch, but any model is better than none

        ### Attribution Pitfalls
        - Do not optimize one channel in isolation based on single-touch attribution
        - Awareness channels (display, social, PR) will always look bad in last-touch models
        - Conversion channels (search, retargeting) will always look bad in first-touch models
        - Self-reported attribution ("how did you hear about us?") provides useful qualitative color but is unreliable as quantitative data
        - Cross-device and cross-channel tracking gaps mean attribution data is always incomplete

        ## Optimization Recommendations Framework

        ### Optimization Process
        1. **Identify**: which metrics are underperforming vs. target or benchmark?
        2. **Diagnose**: where in the funnel is the problem? (impressions, clicks, conversions, retention)
        3. **Hypothesize**: what is causing the underperformance? (audience, message, creative, offer, timing, technical)
        4. **Prioritize**: which fixes will have the biggest impact with the least effort?
        5. **Test**: design an experiment to validate the hypothesis
        6. **Measure**: did the change improve the metric?
        7. **Scale or iterate**: roll out wins broadly; iterate on inconclusive or failed tests

        ### Optimization Levers by Funnel Stage

        | Funnel Stage | Problem Signal | Optimization Levers |
        |-------------|---------------|---------------------|
        | Awareness | Low impressions, low reach | Budget, targeting, channel mix, creative format |
        | Interest | Low CTR, low engagement | Ad creative, headlines, content hooks, audience targeting |
        | Consideration | High bounce rate, low time on page | Landing page content, page speed, content relevance, UX |
        | Conversion | Low conversion rate | Offer, CTA, form length, trust signals, page layout |
        | Retention | High churn, low repeat engagement | Onboarding, email nurture, product experience, support |

        ### Prioritization Framework

        Rank optimization ideas on two dimensions:

        **Impact** (how much will this move the metric?):
        - High: directly addresses the primary bottleneck
        - Medium: addresses a contributing factor
        - Low: incremental improvement

        **Effort** (how hard is this to implement?):
        - Low: copy change, targeting adjustment, simple A/B test
        - Medium: new creative, landing page redesign, workflow change
        - High: new tool, cross-team project, major content production

        Priority order:
        1. High impact, low effort (do immediately)
        2. High impact, high effort (plan and resource)
        3. Low impact, low effort (do if capacity allows)
        4. Low impact, high effort (deprioritize)

        ### Testing Best Practices
        - Test one variable at a time for clean results
        - Define the success metric before launching the test
        - Calculate required sample size before starting (do not end tests early)
        - Run tests for a minimum of one full business cycle (typically one week for B2B)
        - Document all tests and results, regardless of outcome
        - Share learnings across the team — failed tests are valuable information
        - A test that confirms the status quo is not a failure — it builds confidence in your current approach

        ### Continuous Optimization Cadence
        - **Daily**: monitor paid campaigns for budget pacing, anomalies, and disapproved ads
        - **Weekly**: review channel performance, pause underperformers, scale winners
        - **Bi-weekly**: refresh ad creative and test new variants
        - **Monthly**: full performance review, identify new optimization opportunities, update forecasts
        - **Quarterly**: strategic review of channel mix, budget allocation, and targeting strategy
