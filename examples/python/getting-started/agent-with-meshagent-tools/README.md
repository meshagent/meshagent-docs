# Chat and Voice Agent with Built-in MeshAgent Tools

Chat & voice agents using **built-in MeshAgent tools**. 

In this example we add the following MeshAgent toolkits: 
1. **UI**: This toolkit allows the agent to interact with the user using the UI tools. For example, the agent can display a form to the user to gather more information about the task. 
2. **Markitdown**: This toolkit allows the agent to convert a document to markdown. The user can either give the document to the agent directly or add the document to the Room.
3. **DocumentAuthoring**: This toolkit allows the agent to create and edit documents in the room.
