MeshAgent’s [Key Concepts](./key_concepts) page explains what Agents, Tools, and Rooms are. This guide shows how those ideas become real code by walking through the MeshAgent Python SDK.

In this guide you will understand the relationships and key uses for each of the MeshAgent packages: 
- **meshagent.api**: the base layer providing JWT auth, websocket protocols, rooms, messaging, storage, document sync, and webhooks
- **meshagent.tools**: builds on meshagent.api to create reusable tools and toolkits that run inside or outside a room
- **meshagent.agents**: adds agent classes (e.g., TaskRunner, ChatBot) that orchestrate toolkits and planning logic on top of the core API
- **meshagent.openai**: supplies adapters so those agents and tools can leverage OpenAI models and convert tool calls/responses appropriately
- **meshagent.livekit**: plugs in LiveKit for voice communication and streaming, providing specialized agents like VoiceBot
- **meshagent.mcp**: exposes MCP-hosted tools using the same toolkit interface so agents can call them
- **meshagent.computers**: offers abstractions to control browsers or OS environments (useful for automation tools or remote control)
- **meshagent.cli**: wraps everything in a user-facing command line interface for managing projects, tokens, agents, messaging, etc

Together these packages form a layered ecosystem: ``meshagent.api`` → ``tools`` and ``agents`` → integrations like ``openai``, ``livekit``, ``mcp``, ``computers`` → command line utilities via ``meshagent.cli``. This modular design lets developers build agents with custom tools, integrate OpenAI or LiveKit features, and run or deploy them via the CLI.
