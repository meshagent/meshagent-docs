title: Example Deploying a Chatbot as a Project Service
---

Static services that should be the same across the project should be deployed as a project-wide service. These services can be used to manage room specific services run through the Containers API, provide shared functionality, and much more. These services are meant to be generic and not customized by room. 

To learn more about project vs room level services and understand when to use each see [intro to services and containers](../overview).

## Example

Let's create a simple chatbot that can be deployed to all the rooms in our project. This will ensure everyone always has access to an LLM in any room inside the project. To deploy this we'll need the main.py file, a Dockerfile, and a meshagent.yaml file.

### main.py

```python Python
import os
import asyncio
import logging
from meshagent.agents.chat import ChatBot
from meshagent.api.services import ServiceHost
from meshagent.openai import OpenAIResponsesAdapter

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

host = ServiceHost()

@host.path(path="/agent", identity="chatbot")
class MyChatBot(ChatBot): 
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name="chatbot",
            llm_adapter=OpenAIResponsesAdapter(),
        )

asyncio.run(host.run())
```

### Dockerfile

```Dockerfile Dockerfile
FROM meshagent/python-sdk-slim:latest

COPY . /src

WORKDIR /src

ENTRYPOINT [ "python3", "main.py" ]
```

### meshagent.yaml
```yaml yaml
kind: Service
version: v1
name: chatbot

ports:
- num: "*"
  liveness: "/"
  endpoints:
  - path: /agent
    identity: chatbot
    type: meshagent.callable
```

## Build and Push the Container
Now that we've defined our agent and written the applicable Dockerfile and meshagent.yaml we can build and push the docker container. 


## Deploy the Project-Wide Service
From the terminal in the directory with your yaml file simply run:

```bash bash
meshagent setup # authenticate to MeshAgent if not already done
meshagent service create "service.yaml"
```

For more details on deployment see [deploy and run project services](./deployment)

## Use the Service
Now that your service is deployed try it out in [MeshAgent Studio](https://studio.meshagent.com). You'll see the new service in the **Services** tab of the UI. To use the service, simply start a new session and enter the room, the chatbot will appear in the participants tab for you to interact with.
