**MeshAgent Services**

MeshAgent services are user-deployable, containerized extensions that run within a room’s secure sandbox. They enable you to add custom logic, integrations, and tooling to your collaborative environments without managing underlying infrastructure.


## Overview

MeshAgent services allow you to run custom processes alongside a room session. Whether you need AI agents, domain-specific tools, or external system integrations, services provide:

- **Containerized isolation** for secure execution  
- **Automatic scaling** tied to room activity  
- **Seamless access** to room context and storage  

Services behave similarly to serverless functions—automatically starting and stopping with room sessions—but remain co-located within the room environment for low latency and deep integration.

## Key Features

- **Custom Code Deployment**  
  Run arbitrary container images (e.g. agents built with OpenAI Agent SDK, Pydantic Agents, CrewAI, Semantic Kernel).
  
- **Automatic Lifecycle Management**  
  Services start when a room session begins and terminate upon session end, ensuring efficient resource usage.

- **Runtime Configuration**  
  Inject secrets and environment variables for API keys, database credentials, or feature flags.

- **Localhost Networking**  
  Expose one or more ports to enable inter-service communication over localhost.

- **Optional Storage Mounts**  
  Grant services direct read/write access to a room’s persistent storage.

- **Integrated Tool Exposure**  
  MeshAgent automatically converts services using the MCP SSE protocol into room-native tools available to participants.

- **Health & Readiness Probes**  
  Define liveness checks to prevent participants from connecting until all services are operational.

## Service Lifecycle

1. **Session Start**  
   - Upon the first participant or agent connecting, MeshAgent initializes the room and starts all configured services simultaneously.

2. **Active Session**  
   - Services remain running as long as there is at least one active connection. They can process data, communicate via the room API, and interact with storage.

3. **Session End**  
   - When the last participant disconnects, MeshAgent gracefully shuts down services, freeing resources until the next session.

## Configuration Options

Services can be customized via the MeshAgent Studio’s **Services** tab:

- **Image Selection**  
  Choose from public or private container registries. For private images, configure a pull secret to grant access.

- **Environment Variables & Secrets**  
  - Define key/value environment variables  
  - Reference secure secrets (e.g., API tokens, database URIs)

- **Port Definitions**  
  Expose ports for HTTP servers, gRPC endpoints, or custom protocols; accessible to other services and room clients over localhost.

- **Storage Mount**  
  Optionally mount the room’s storage volume into the service container, enabling direct file access.

- **Health Checks**  
  - **Liveness**: periodically verify the service process is alive  
  - **Readiness**: ensure availability before allowing room connections

## Communication & Security

- **Isolated Containers**  
  Each service runs in its own sandbox, ensuring that secrets and environment variables are scoped per service. One service cannot read another’s configuration.

- **Room API Integration**  
  Services interact with the room through the MeshAgent Room API, enabling messaging, event subscriptions, and storage operations.

- **Low-Latency Networking**  
  Co-location within the room environment and localhost networking dramatically reduce communication delays compared to external serverless functions.

## Use Cases & Examples

1. **AI Agent Orchestration**  
   Deploy a semantic-kernel-based agent that processes user queries and writes responses directly to the room chat.

2. **Voice Agents**  
   Run a long-lived voice transcription and synthesis service—difficult to host in traditional serverless—allowing real-time audio interaction in the room.

3. **Custom Business Logic**  
   Spin up an MCP server as a service to handle domain-specific workflows (e.g., data validation, report generation), automatically surfaced as tools for room participants.

4. **Data Processing Pipelines**  
   Mount room storage into a service that ingests, transforms, and outputs data files, with progress updates sent back via the room API.

5. **Secure Integrations**  
   Use environment-injected secrets to connect to third-party APIs (e.g., CRM systems, analytics platforms) entirely within the room sandbox.

## Managing Services

- **Adding a New Service**  
  1. Navigate to the **Services** tab in MeshAgent Studio.  
  2. Click **Add Service**, supply image and configuration details.  
  3. Save to apply; the service will start on the next room session.

- **Updating an Existing Service**  
  - Edit environment variables, ports, or health probes and save changes.  
  - New configurations take effect on the next session restart.

- **Monitoring & Logs**  
  - View service logs in real time via the MeshAgent Studio log viewer.  
  - Health check statuses and container events are surfaced alongside room diagnostics.
