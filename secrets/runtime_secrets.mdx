title: Runtime Secrets API
---

The **Secrets API** lets room participants (or agents/tools acting on their behalf) store and retrieve **per-user credentials** during a live session. This is most often used for OAuth flows, but works for any credential you need to keep tied to an individual user rather than a project-wide service.

## What it provides

- **Interactive OAuth flows**: Request a token, trigger a sign-in prompt for the user, and get back access + refresh tokens.
- **Automatic refresh**: Tokens are refreshed automatically before expiry if a refresh token is available.
- **Offline access**: Services can reuse stored credentials without bothering the user again.
- **Inventory and cleanup**: List what secrets you have stored, or delete ones you no longer need.


## Core API Methods
- ``request_oauth_token``: Request or refresh a user token. Emits an event if the user needs to approve.
- ``provide_oauth_authorization``: Client responds to that event, either approving or denying access.
- ``get_offline_oauth_token``:  Retrieve the latest valid credential for background use.
- ``list_secrets``: View stored secrets (metadata only, never raw values).
- ``delete_secret``: Remove a stored secret.
