title: Run Room Containers
---

Room containers are the on-demand way to run your code inside a specific room. They create a secure sandbox alongside live participants and stop automatically when you or MeshAgent tear them down.

## Launch Options

### MeshAgent Studio
MeshAgent Studio allows you to run a container by pulling and running an image from a repository or from Git repos that contain a Dockerfile and ``meshagent.yaml`` file. 

1. Go to [MeshAgent Studio](https://studio.meshagent.com).
2. Create a new session ``myroom`` and go to the room. 
3. From the developer console on the bottom of the screen select **Images**. 
4. Select either ***Build Image** to build the image from a Git Repository or **Pull Image** to pull the image from a docker repository. This will pull and start your container, if any variables are required you'll be prompted to input the values before the container starts.
5. Your service should now be running in a container. Click the **Containers** tab to see logs for the container. 

### MeshAgent CLI

Launch containers programmatically or from a terminal:

For example using the chatbot we defined in the [configuration docs](./configuration): 

```bash
meshagent setup # authenticate to MeshAgent 
meshagent container run \
  --project-id <project-id> \
  --room my-room \
  --image my-agent:v2 \
  --command "python main.py" \
  --env SYSTEM_PROMPT="You summarize meetings" \
  --var tone=formal 
```

- Use ``--var`` for template variables (converted into ``{variable}`` placeholders).
- Use ``--env`` for direct environment variables.
- ``--cred`` supplies temporary registry credentials if the image is private.

## Managing Active Containers

- **Stream logs**: ``meshagent container logs --id <container-id>``
- **Stop a container**: ``meshagent container stop --id <container-id>``

Inside MeshAgent Studio, the room sidebar shows active containers with controls to stop or relaunch them.

## Lifecycle
- Containers start with the parameters supplied at launch.
- They can be long running, but if the room becomes inactive or you explicitly stop them, MeshAgent cleans them up.
- You can write a project service that orchestrates room containers (e.g., a service can be responsible for starting agents that users have saved to their room), but the containers themselves remain scoped to the room that launched them.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Suggestion |
| --- | --- |
| Image pull failures | Ensure ``--cred`` values are correct |
| Port conflicts | Use ``num: "*"`` in the template to have MeshAgent auto-assign an available port. |
| Missing environment variables | Confirm variables are defined in the template and spelled correctly in ``--var``/``--env`` flags. |
| Container not starting | Verify Dockerfile has all required libraries and add logs to your system to troubleshoot issues. |

## Next Steps
- Check out [project services](../project_services/deployment) if the service should auto-start in all rooms.
- Learn how MeshAgent injects credentials in [Secrets & Registry Access](../secrets).
- Explore the [Operations](../operations) page for deeper observability guidance.
