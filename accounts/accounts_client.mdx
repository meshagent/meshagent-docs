title: Accounts Client
---
The Accounts API is MeshAgent's control plane: it manages projects, rooms, users, and the room-level policies that later become participant tokens. The Python SDK ships an async helper, `meshagent.api.accounts_client.AccountsClient`, that wraps these routes.

## Getting started
```python
from meshagent.api.accounts_client import AccountsClient

client = AccountsClient(
    base_url="https://api.meshagent.com",  # optional; defaults to MESHAGENT_API_URL
    token="<bearer-access-token>"
)

# ...use the client...

await client.close()  # tidy up the internal aiohttp session
```

- `base_url` defaults to `meshagent.api.helpers.meshagent_base_url()`, which honours the `MESHAGENT_API_URL` environment variable.
- `token` must be a bearer token authorised to administer the project (typically an API key token or a user session token).

Every method raises `meshagent.api.RoomException` on non-2xx responses and validates responses with Pydantic models, so malformed payloads surface as rich errors.

## Managing project room grants
Project room grants store a user's allowed `ApiScope` for a specific room. They are persisted as `ProjectRoomGrant { room, user_id, permissions }` records and later copied into the runtime [`ParticipantToken`](../room_api/participant_tokens).

Key methods:

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `create_room_grant(project_id, room_id, user_id, permissions)` | Creates a grant (POST `/accounts/projects/{project_id}/room-grants`). Accepts an `ApiScope` instance for `permissions`. |
| `update_room_grant(project_id, room_id, user_id, permissions)` | Replaces the stored `ApiScope` for an existing grant (PUT `/room-grants`). |
| `get_room_grant(project_id, room_id, user_id)` | Returns the persisted `ProjectRoomGrant` (GET `/room-grants/{room_id}/{user_id}`). |
| `list_room_grants(project_id, limit?, offset?, order_by?)` | Lists every grant in a project with pagination support. |
| `list_room_grants_by_user(project_id, user_id, ...)` | Lists the rooms a specific user can access. |
| `list_room_grants_by_room(project_id, room_id, ...)` | Lists the users that have access to a room. |
| `list_unique_rooms_with_grants(project_id, ...)` | Returns `ProjectRoomGrantCount` objects summarising how many grants exist per room. |
| `list_unique_users_with_grants(project_id, ...)` | Returns `ProjectUserGrantCount` objects summarising grant counts per user. |

Example: assign a user read-only storage access in a room.

```python
from meshagent.api.accounts_client import AccountsClient
from meshagent.api.participant_token import ApiScope, StorageGrant, StoragePathGrant

scope = ApiScope(
    storage=StorageGrant(paths=[StoragePathGrant(path="/data", read_only=True)])
)

await client.create_room_grant(
    project_id="proj_123",
    room_id="room_456",
    user_id="user_789",
    permissions=scope,
)
```

When that user connects, the router copies `scope` into the `api` grant of the token it mints (`cloud_router_server.connect_room`).

## Other administration helpers
The client also exposes utilities for day-to-day project administration:

- **Room lifecycle**: create, rename, delete rooms; fetch room metadata.
- **Project membership**: add/remove users, check roles, and list members.
- **Storage helpers**: upload and download files under `/accounts/projects/{project_id}/storage/*`.
- **OAuth clients**: create, update, list, and delete OAuth client records for project integrations.

Refer to the inline docstrings in `meshagent.api.accounts_client` for the complete list of endpoints. Each method name mirrors the REST path (for example `create_room` calls `POST /accounts/projects/{project_id}/rooms`).
