# Our First Tool

Let's create a simple tool that can add two numbers and connect it to our room:

+++ Python
:::code source="/examples/python/tools-adder.py":::
+++

From the studio, if we select "Run" and then "Add Tools" this tool will show up under the "adder" menu. 
Under the tool description, you will see a play icon and an info icon. Pressing the info icon will
show you a JSON schema that you can use to connect this tool to LLMs like OpenAI. Pressing the play icon
will allow you to invoke the tool. Press the play icon and an agent will be launched that will generate
a user interface to test the agent. If you watch your agent in the console, you will see it print the result
when it is invoked.


# Calling Tools

By default, a tool that connects to a room is available to everyone in the room.  Keep our agent from the 
previous sample connected to the room, or restart it if you have already stopped it. 
In another tab, let's try invoking the tool from another client. 

+++ Python
:::code source="/examples/python/tools-calling.py":::
+++

# Discovering Tools

At any time, a client can discover what tools have been connected to the room. This can be useful if you want
to allow your users to be able to grant additional capabilities to your agents at runtime, or even if you
just want to give users the ability to use the tools themselves:

+++ Python
:::code source="/examples/python/tools-discovery.py":::
