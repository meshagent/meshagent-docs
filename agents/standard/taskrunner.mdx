title: "TaskRunner Overview"
---

``TaskRunner`` builds on ``SingleRoomAgent`` to let you wrap any existing agent or function and run it inside a MeshAgent room. You define an input schema, an output schema (optional), and an ``ask()`` method that does the work. TaskRunners can be discovered and invoked from MeshAgent Studio (Run Task…) or programmatically via ``room.agents.ask(...)``.

Think of ``TaskRunner`` as a thin execution adapter: it handles room connection, registration, validation, toolkit resolution, and request routing so you can focus on your logic—Pydantic AI, LangChain, CrewAI, or plain Python.

## When to Use It
- You already have agent logic and want to run it in a room without rewriting it.
- You need a typed boundary for requests/results (JSON Schema).
- You want to expose agents as tools other agents can call (via RunTaskTool / agents toolkit).

If you need a conversational, message-based assistant, use [ChatBot](./chatbot). For real-time speech, see [VoiceBot](./voicebot). 

## Constructor Arguments
``TaskRunner`` accepts everything from ``SingleRoomAgent`` (``name``, ``title``, ``description``, ``requires``, ``labels``) plus task-specific parameters.

| Argument         | Type                    | Description                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `supports_tools` | `bool \| None`          | Whether callers can pass ad-hoc toolkits at runtime (default `False`).                           |
| `input_schema`   | `dict`                  | **Required.** JSON Schema for request arguments. If `None`, defaults to a “no-arguments” schema. |
| `output_schema`  | `dict \| None`          | Optional JSON Schema for responses; if set, responses are validated.                             |
| `toolkits`       | `list[Toolkit] \| None` | Local toolkits always available to this TaskRunner (in addition to any `requires`).              |
