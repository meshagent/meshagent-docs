# Introduction to MeshAgent

MeshAgent is a developer-first platform designed to seamlessly connect people and AI agents, allowing them to engage and collaborate with each other in real time. By focusing on both flexibility and ease of integration across platforms, MeshAgent addresses the complex challenges of building interfaces that make AI agents accessible, responsive, and secure. Its robust environment empowers developers to create cohesive, human-centered experiences, ensuring that AI capabilities are fully leveraged while remaining intuitive and user-friendly. MeshAgent’s streamlined approach to agent integration paves the way for a new era of human-AI collaboration, giving projects the tools they need to build smarter, more connected solutions.

## Problems MeshAgent solves

Ultimately, MeshAgent is about bringing people and AI closer together. It’s about making all those behind-the-scenes complexities—real-time syncing, language barriers, and communication methods—fade away, so you can focus on what really matters: building something remarkable, faster and smarter, with an AI that feels like part of your project. To deliver these kinds of solutions, MeshAgent solves a variety problems for you out of the box.

### Realtime Synchronization
Let’s imagine you’re working on a big project. Your AI partner is right there with you—reviewing documents, sketching out designs, offering insights—just like a projectmate in the same room. That’s the essence of synchronization. Real-time updates matter. If you change a color in a design or edit a paragraph in a document, your AI should instantly see what you’re doing and respond accordingly. Everything stays perfectly in sync, and both you and your AI collaborator move forward together without missing a beat.

### Cross-Platform Delivery
Now, consider the diversity of tools modern projects rely on. In a single afternoon, you might open a .NET application, jump to a React-based web platform, then finish your day in a Flutter app. You don’t think about the language behind each product—you just use them. With MeshAgent, AI agents can do the same. They’re designed to be truly cross-platform, able to interact seamlessly with any framework, library, or programming language. Whether it’s JavaScript, C#, Python, or anything else, agents can integrate without boundaries.

### Multi-Modal Communication
True collaboration means more than just text messages. A brilliant AI partner should be able to hear you speak, respond aloud in its own voice, show you images, or even co-present a slideshow. That’s what we mean by communication—a richer, more natural way for humans and AI to work in tandem. By offering voice interaction, image generation, and more, MeshAgent transforms AI from a chat window into a true creative partner.

# How MeshAgent works

MeshAgent's architecture consists of the following key components

- **MeshAgent Server:** Acts as a switchboard for people and agents, allowing them to work together securely in rooms, share documents, and exchange messages.
- **MeshAgent Client SDKs:** Cross platform clients that you can use from .NET, Javascript, Dart, Python, and more. Mix and match as needed. An agent can be running on a python server and presenting content to your users in a React web app and a Flutter mobile app at the same time for example.
- **MeshAgent Tools:** Intergration with a wide variety of tools, from text to speech and image generation to document parsing and messaging allows you to easily add rich capabilities to your agents.
- **MeshAgent Framework:** Foundational components for common agent patterns like listening to changes, interacting via voice, and constructing documents.
- **MeshAgent UI:** A set of reusable user interface blocks to accelerate the delivery of compelling experiences.
- **MeshAgent Developer Console:** Test and communicate with your agents and examine their outputs from day one. 

# Build a MeshAgent implementation

1. Sign up for MeshAgent Cloud to get up and running without installing any infrastructure
2. Get an access token
3. Build an agent using the MeshAgent Client SDKs
4. Integrate your agent into your application using MeshAgent UI or your own custom code.
5. Test and optimize with the MeshAgent Developer Console
6. Deploy your agent to your favorite cloud or on premise host

# Deployment considerations

When deploying your solution, you can either use the MeshAgent Cloud or deploy your own customized MeshAgent Server in your own cloud or on premise environment.
