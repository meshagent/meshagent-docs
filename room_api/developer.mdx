`DeveloperClient` enables inspection and debugging `RoomClient` through message logs. It listens for `developer.log` messages from the server and emits them locally as `RoomLogEvent` objects.

---

## Overview

- **`DeveloperClient`** – A high-level client that listens for `developer.log` events and provides methods to watch, unwatch, and send developer logs.

## API Methods

Below is an example of how you might use the `DeveloperClient` in your code:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Suppose you already have a RoomClient instance named `room`.

# Enable developer logs
await room.developer.enable()

# Send a developer log
await room.developer.log("info", {
    "message": "Hello from Python!"
})

# Disable developer logs
await room.developer.disable()
```
```js JavaScript
// Suppose you already have a RoomClient instance named `room`.

// Enable developer logs
await room.developer.enable();

// Send a developer log
await room.developer.log("info", {
    "message": "Hello from JavaScript!"
});

// Disable developer logs
await room.developer.disable();
```
```ts TypeScript
// Suppose you already have a RoomClient instance named `room`.

// Enable developer logs
await room.developer.enable();

// Send a developer log
await room.developer.log("info", {
    "message": "Hello from TypeScript!"
});

// Disable developer logs
await room.developer.disable();
```
```dart Dart
// Suppose you already have a RoomClient instance named `room`.

// Enable developer logs
await room.developer.enable();

// Send a developer log
await room.developer.log("info", {
    "message": "Hello from Dart!"
});

// Disable developer logs
await room.developer.disable();
```
</CodeGroup>

### `DeveloperClient`

A client that listens for `developer.log` events and provides methods to enable, disable, and log custom developer messages.

- **`room: RoomClient`**  
An instance of `RoomClient`, which handles the underlying communication with the server.



#### `log(type: string, data: Record<string, any>)`

Sends a `developer.log` message to the server with the specified type and data. This can be used to track custom logs, diagnostics, or other developer-related messages in your application.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
await room.developer.log("warn", {
    "status": "Something might be wrong"
})
```
```js JavaScript
await room.developer.log("warn", {
    "status": "Something might be wrong"
});
```
```ts TypeScript
await room.developer.log("warn", {
    "status": "Something might be wrong"
});
```
```dart Dart
await room.developer.log("warn", {
    "status": "Something might be wrong"
});
```
</CodeGroup>


- **Parameters**:
  - `type` – A string identifying the log level or category, such as `"info"`, `"warn"`, or `"debug"`.
  - `data` – A JSON-serializable object containing additional details for the log entry.

- **Description**  
  Encodes the `type` and `data` into a message, then sends it to the server. This message is typically consumed by developers or other backend listeners for debugging or monitoring purposes.

---


#### `enable()`

Watches developer messages on the server, effectively enabling the reception of `developer.log` events.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
await room.developer.enable()
```
```js JavaScript
await room.developer.enable();
```
```ts TypeScript
await room.developer.enable();
```
```dart Dart
await room.developer.enable();
```
</CodeGroup>

- **Description**  
  Sends a `developer.watch` message to the server to start receiving `developer.log` events. If the server is configured to honor these watch requests, it will begin sending any future developer logs to this client.

---


#### `disable()`

Unwatches developer messages on the server, stopping the reception of `developer.log` events.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
await room.developer.disable()
```
```js JavaScript
await room.developer.disable();
```
```ts TypeScript
await room.developer.disable();
```
```dart Dart
await room.developer.disable();
```
</CodeGroup>


- **Description**  
  Sends a `developer.unwatch` message to the server to stop receiving `developer.log` events. Further developer logs from the server will be ignored until `enable()` is called again.

---


## Additional Notes

- **Event Emission**  
  The `DeveloperClient` extends an `EventEmitter<RoomLogEvent>`. It emits a `"log"` event whenever a `developer.log` message is received from the server. You can listen to these events as follows:
  
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
room.developer.on("log", lambda event: print("Developer log event:", event))
```
```js JavaScript
room.developer.on("log", (event) => console.log("Developer log event:", event));
```
```ts TypeScript
room.developer.on("log", (event) => console.log("Developer log event:", event));
```
```dart Dart
room.developer.on("log", (event) => print("Developer log event: $event"));
```
</CodeGroup>


- **Integration with `RoomClient`**  
  Internally, `DeveloperClient` uses the same `Protocol` instance attached to `RoomClient` to send and receive developer-related messages. If `RoomClient` is disconnected, messages will not be delivered.

- **Error Handling**  
  If a request fails or the server returns an error, the underlying `RoomClient` may throw an exception (e.g., `RoomServerException`). Handle it accordingly in your code:


<CodeGroup>
```python Python
try:
  await room.developer.enable()
except Exception as err:
  print("Failed to enable developer logs:", err)
```
```js JavaScript
try {
  await room.developer.enable();
} catch (err) {
  console.error("Failed to enable developer logs:", err);
}
```ts TypeScript
try {
  await room.developer.enable();
} catch (err) {
  console.error("Failed to enable developer logs:", err);
}
```
```dart Dart
try {
  await room.developer.enable();
} catch (err) {
  print("Failed to enable developer logs: $err");
}
```
</CodeGroup>


- **Extensibility**  
  You can extend or wrap `DeveloperClient` to include additional developer-oriented features, such as profiling, advanced filtering, or forwarding logs to other services.
