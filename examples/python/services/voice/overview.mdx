## Overview
MeshAgent Rooms can be used to host voice agents. The VoiceBot class in the meshagent-livekit package connects a Livekit based voice agent to the room. From 
within the studio, the agent will show up in the messaging pane.

Within a Flutter app the VoiceAgentCaller widget be used to start a Voice agent session.

## Build a Voice Agent

To create a voice service that will run in every room:
```
meshagent service create --name "voice" --image docker.io/meshagent/sample-voice:0.0.31 --env="MESHAGENT_PORT=8090" --port "num=8090 type=meshagent.callable liveness=/ path=/agent participant_name=voice"
```

If you want to test the voice with a single room:
```
meshagent service test --room my-room --name "voice" --image docker.io/meshagent/sample-voice:0.0.31 --env="MESHAGENT_PORT=8090" --port "num=8090 type=meshagent.callable liveness=/ path=/agent participant_name=voice"
```

Here is the voice service code if you want to create your own app:
