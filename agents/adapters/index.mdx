title: "Adapters Overview"

Adapters connect MeshAgent to external LLMs and standardize how tool results flow back into conversations. These adapters are important for any agent that uses an LLM, for example `ChatBot`s and `MailBot`s.

- **LLM Adapters**: Talk to a model (from a provider like OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), translate the chat context into the provider’s request format, and stream the model’s responses back.
- **Tool Response Adapters**: Convert tool outputs into messages that match what the provider and UI expect (e.g., text, JSON blobs, links, files).

Most people start with the built-in OpenAI adapters, but you can implement your own to integrate additional LLM vendors, customise defaults, or change how tool responses are handled.
