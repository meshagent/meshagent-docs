# MeshAgent
MeshAgent is your **end-to-end platform for building, deploying, and operating AI agents -- collaboratively, securely, and at any scale**.  

MeshAgent removes the infrastructure headaches of real-time agent collaboration by spinning up secure Rooms that connect humans, agents, and shared context. Paired with a developer-friendly SDK, a browser-based Studio, and a fully-managed Cloud service (MeshAgent Server), MeshAgent lets you launch, share, and refine agents in hours instead of weeks.

## Core building blocks

| Component | What it does | Typical use |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **MeshAgent SDK** | Language clients (Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Dart) that wrap Rooms, agents, messaging, storage, queues, and observability APIs. | Code your agent and call platform services with a few lines of code. |
| **MeshAgent Studio** | Browser workspace + CLI for prototyping, testing tools, evaluating agents, and inviting teammates into a live Room. | Iterate quickly and gather feedback throughout agent development and deployment. |
| **MeshAgent Server** | Managed backend that hosts agents, provisions secure Rooms, scales infrastructure, and exposes usage & billing dashboards. | Run agents in production without maintaining underlying infrastructure. |

## Why MeshAgent?

- **Enable multi-player AI with real-time Rooms**: Secure workspaces, "Rooms", spin up when the first human or agent joins and vanish when they leave, allowing everyone to share context and collaborate.
- **Create and share agents in hours, not weeks**: invite teammates into a **secure, access-controlled** MeshAgent Studio Room to test your in-progress agent in any browser. Iterate on their feedback, deploy the agent, and then publish a shareable URL so authorized users can interact with the production version of your agent -- no  code checkout, IDE, or GPU management required. 
- **Monitor agents with live logs & traces**: Streaming telemetry surfaces every message, tool call, and error across Rooms for rapid troubleshooting and enhanced agent understanding.  
- **Track and manage costs across agent projects**: Usage and billing views break down minutes and credits by project, Room, and agent, keeping budgets transparent and under control.  
- **Accelerate Agent development with MeshAgent Studio**: A browser-based workspace to develop, test, debug, monitor, and iterate on agents. 
- **Standardize agent deployment and scale securely with enterprise grade governance**: MeshAgent provides a uniform way to create, deploy, and manage agents. It automatically provisions and retires secure Rooms as participants come and go, scaling agents and collaboration spaces up or down as demand changes.
- **Code in your preferred language**: The same feature set (Rooms, Agents, Tools, Messaging, Queues, Storage, Documents, etc.) is exposed through official Python, Javascript, Typescript, and Dart SDKs, so teams can stay productive in their preferred stack.
