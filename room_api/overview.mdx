MeshAgent Rooms provide real-time collaborative workspaces for agents and participants. Each room dynamically manages participant lists, tracks presence, and enables information sharing. Rooms are automatically provisioned when participants join, ensuring effortless integration and minimizing synchronization complexity.

Rooms also serve as gateways to several additional APIs accessible through the room object:

- **Agents API `AgentsClient`:** Manages agent interactions. 
- **Database API `DatabaseClient`:** Provides a simple relational-like API for data storage and retrieval through tables.
- **Queues API `QueuesClient`:** Facilitates reliable data/message exchange with other agents or participants.
- **Messaging API `MessagingClient`:** Enables real-time chat messaging among participants.
- **Sync API `SyncClient`:** Offers document synchronization capabilities, listing remote participants, allowing participants to collaborate on shared documents.
- **Storage API `StorageClient`:** Manages file storage and retrieval.

### Let's connect to a room

First, be sure to have followed the [Getting Started with MeshAgent Docs](../introduction/get_started.mdx).

Next, in your terminal authenticate to MeshAgent and export the environment variables needed to connect to your MeshAgent project. You can do this using the MeshAgent CLI.

<CodeGroup>
```bash bash
meshagent auth login
meshagent project activate -i
meshagent api-key activate -i
meshagent env
```
</CodeGroup>

Now run the code to connect to a MeshAgent room. 

<CodeGroup>
    <RoomConnectPy />
    <RoomConnectJs />
    <RoomConnectTs />
    <RoomConnectDart />
</CodeGroup>
