This guide will help you understand the **core building blocks that make MeshAgent a powerful platform for building, deploying, and operating AI agents** — collaboratively, securely, and at any scale. By the end of this document you will understand how **Agents**, **Tools**, and **Rooms** work together to **create seamless AI powered experiences**. 

## Core Concepts at a Glance: Agents, Tools, and Rooms
MeshAgent enables people, AI agents, and external capabilities (tools) to meet in a secure **Room** where they can collaborate in real-time, share context, and work together toward common goals.

- **Agents**: LLM powered entities that can understand natural language, make decisions, and perform tasks. Giving agents tools extends their capabilities by allowing them to take action on your behalf -- something an LLM itself cannot do. 
- **Tools**: Capabilities registered in the Room and callable by participants. Agents can be equipped with specific tools, and human participants can invoke registered tools. 
- **Rooms**: A temporary, secure collaboration space that automatically spins up when the first participant arrives and vanishes when the last one leaves. All context, conversations, and shared resources live within the Room. Rooms are provisioned on demand and can scale up or down as your demand changes.

### What are Rooms?
MeshAgent Rooms provide a shared workspace for agents and participants to collaborate in real time. Each room includes a participant list, presence tracking, and a mechanism for sharing information. Because MeshAgent is designed for seamless integration, rooms are provisioned on demand as participants connect. This eliminates the complexity of syncing rules and allows agents and people to quickly spin up a shared environment to collaborate in.

- **Temporary by design**  
  A room is provisioned when the first participant joins and deprovisioned when the last participant leaves. It only exists to facilitate communication during the session.

- **No state persistence**  
 The MeshAgent admin console logs session activity for debugging, such as which agents participated and what questions were asked. However, the state of the room will be discarded at the end of the session, so any data that should persist after the session ends needs to be written to an external storage provider.

- **Document management**  
A room can help participants discover, sync, and share documents when they connect to it, but the room only temporarily stores MeshDocuments in memory while they are open. When documents are modified, or a session ends, the changes are written to an external storage provider. By default, MeshAgent Cloud provides a storage folder (named for the room) where documents are kept. For more complex scenarios, you can configure an existing storage solution using a custom provider and save the documents in your own database or storage buckets.
