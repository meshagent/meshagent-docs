# Rooms

Meshagent Rooms provide real-time collaborative workspaces for agents and participants. Each room dynamically manages participant lists, tracks presence, and enables information sharing. Rooms are automatically provisioned when participants join, ensuring effortless integration and minimizing synchronization complexity.

Rooms also serve as gateways to several additional APIs accessible through the room object:

- **Agents API `AgentsClient`:** Manages agent interactions. 
- **Database API `DatabaseClient`:** Provides a simple relational-like API for data storage and retrieval through tables.
- **Queues API `QueuesClient`:** Facilitates reliable data/message exchange with other agents or participants.
- **Messaging API `MessagingClient`:** Enables real-time chat messaging among participants.
- **Sync API `SyncClient`:** Offers document synchronization capabilities, listing remote participants, allowing participants to collaborate on shared documents.
- **Storage API `StorageClient`:** Manages file storage and retrieval.

### Key Functionalities

- **Ephemeral Design:** Automatically provisioned when the first participant joins and deprovisioned when the last leaves, existing only during active collaboration.
- **No State Persistence:** Logs session details in the admin console; the room state itself is discarded after the session ends.
- **Document Management:** Provides temporary in-memory document synchronization and sharing. Document changes persist to external storage on modification or session end. Meshagent Cloud includes built-in storage, with custom external providers supported.
