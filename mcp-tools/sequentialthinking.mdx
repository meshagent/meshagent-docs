title: Sequential Thinking
---


The following quickstart guide demonstrates how to launch the Sequential Thinking MCP server and a chatbot, scoped to a Meshagent Room in the cloud. When the Room closes, all associated tools and agents are automatically removed.

1. **Install Meshagent CLI and dependencies**  
   ```
   pip install "meshagent[all]"
   ```

2. **Sign up and authenticate**  
   See [Meshagent CLI Getting Started](https://docs.meshagent.com/cli/getting_started) for signup and authentication steps.

3. **Spin up the Sequential Thinking MCP server agent inside a test room**  
   ```
   meshagent service test --room=test --role=agent --image=meshagent/mcp-sequentialthinking:latest --env MESHAGENT_PORT=8001 --port="num=8001 path=/webhook liveness=/ type=meshagent.callable" --name=mcp-sequentialthinking-service-test
   ```
   > This starts a Meshagent Room and launches a test MCP server available for tools usage inside that room. Note: Meshagent Rooms will close if they go inactive.

4. **Start a chatbot in the Meshagent room that can access the Sequential Thinking toolkit**  
   ```
   meshagent chatbot join --room=test --agent-name=mcp-sequentialthinking --name=mcp-sequentialthinking --toolkit=mcp-sequentialthinking
   ```
   - This starts a chatbot in the `test` room; the chatbot can now use the Sequential Thinking MCP toolkit.
   - Multiple toolkits can be attached to a single agent if needed.
   - A room link will be shown in the output of this command.

5. **Use and test**  
   - Visit the provided room link in your browser.
   - Send a message to the agent to interact and experiment with the MCP server tools live.

## Project Level Deployment (Persistent Services for Production)

To make MCP server tools and chatbots consistently available in all new rooms created within a Meshagent project (ideal for production use-cases), deploy the following persistent services:

1. **Create a persistent MCP server service**  
   ```
   meshagent service create --role=agent --image=meshagent/mcp-sequentialthinking:latest --env MESHAGENT_PORT=8001 --port="num=8001 path=/webhook liveness=/ type=meshagent.callable" --name=mcp-sequentialthinking-service
   ```

2. **Create a persistent chatbot agent service**  
   ```
   meshagent service create --image="meshagent/cli:latest" --port="num=9001 path=/agent liveness=/ type=meshagent.callable participant_name=mcp-sequentialthinking-chatbot" --env="MESHAGENT_PORT=9001" --name="mcp-sequentialthinking-chatbot-service" --command="meshagent chatbot service --agent-name=mcp-sequentialthinking-chatbot --toolkit=mcp-sequentialthinking"
   ```
- These services will now auto-join every time a room is created in the projectâ€”users no longer need to run or maintain local servers, agents, or chatbots.

## Tools Available

### Sequential Thinking Toolkit

**Tools provided by this Server**
| Tool               | Short Description                                                           |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sequentialthinking` | A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.|

### Tool Details

#### Tool: **`sequentialthinking`**
A tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts. This tool analyzes problems through a flexible, iterative sequence, where each thought can build on, revise, or question previous steps. Adaptivity and revision are core features.

**When to use:**
- Breaking down complex/multi-step problems
- Planning or analysis requiring revision or deep context
- Tasks requiring branching, course correction, or evolving understanding

**Key Features:**
- Dynamically adjust the required number of thinking steps (`total_thoughts`)
- Question or revise earlier thoughts
- Add more thoughts even after reaching an apparent conclusion
- Express uncertainty and explore alternative solutions
- Branch or backtrack as necessary
- Generates and verifies a solution hypothesis
- Repeats the process until reaching a satisfactory solution

**Parameters:**
| Parameter           | Type       | Description                                              |
|---------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `nextThoughtNeeded` | `boolean`  | Whether another thought step is needed                   |
| `thought`           | `string`   | Current thinking step                                    |
| `thoughtNumber`     | `integer`  | Current thought number                                   |
| `totalThoughts`     | `integer`  | Estimated total thoughts needed                          |
| `branchFromThought` | `integer` (optional) | Branching point (step number)                 |
| `branchId`          | `string` (optional)  | Branch identifier                               |
| `isRevision`        | `boolean` (optional) | Revises earlier thinking?                         |
| `needsMoreThoughts` | `boolean` (optional) | Whether more thoughts are needed                  |
| `revisesThought`    | `integer` (optional) | Which thought is being reconsidered               |

**Usage guidance:**
- Adjust your approach or step count as you learn more
- Mark and manage revisions and branches clearly
- Aim for clarity, correctness, and the ability to revise incomplete solutions
