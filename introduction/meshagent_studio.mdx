title: MeshAgent Studio
---

[MeshAgent Studio](https://studio.meshagent.com) is the browser-based developer workspace for MeshAgent. Use it to test, share, and deploy your agents and tools as you build the front end for your agentic application.

With [MeshAgent Studio](https://studio.meshagent.com) you can: 
- Create projects and rooms and jump between them.
- Inspect sessions (logs, traces, metrics) for live debugging.
- Invite teammates and manage roles/permissions.
- Create/rotate API Keys.
- Deploy and manage services (project‑level and room‑scoped).
- Manage Secrets and Image Pull Secrets.
- Set up Webhooks.
- Configure Integrations (bring your own OpenAI key/base URL; export OTEL telemetry).
- Create OAuth clients for MeshAgent sign‑in for your apps.
- Review Usage dashboards: active rooms, participants, cost, most‑used tools, and tool latency.
- Create room‑scoped mailboxes.
- Handle Billing: track spend, purchase credits, and enable auto‑reload.

## Project selector and account menu

MeshAgent Studio opens to an active project. Use the dropdown in the upper-left corner to switch between projects you belong to or create a new one. Select the menu option in the upper-right corner to logout. 

## Rooms
Use rooms to isolate agent runtime environments. Rooms are secure environments where humans and agents can collaborate and share context. Rooms can have their own set of services and mailboxes. 

From the MeshAgent Studio UI you can: 
- **Create** a room with **New Room**
- Toggle between **My Rooms** (filtered view of the rooms you've joined or been added to in the active project) and **All Rooms** which lists every room that exists in the project (subject to your project role). 
- From the menu icon on a room you can select: 
    - **Edit** to rename the room or add a description
    - **Services** to view, add, remove, or edit room specific services
    - **Permissions** to manange user access and grants to a specific room
    - **Delete** to permanently delete the room

## Sessions 
Monitor and debug live and recent room sessions. A session starts when a room starts and stops when the room stops. You can toggle between **Active Sessions** and **Recent Sessions** across rooms. 

Select a session to see **Logs, Traces, and Metrics** for detailed insights into the activities that occurred during a given room session. This is helpful for debugging live and reviewing recent activities. 

## Room Workspace (inside a Room)
From both the **Rooms** and **Sessions** tabs you can select a room to enter the **Room Workspace**. The room workspace is where you will develop, test, and iterate on agents and tools. Opening a room starts a new Session; you can invite others to the session to observe behavior and collect feedback. When you deploy services, they remain available to the room beyond any single session.

### Layout
- **File Browser (left)**: Browse room files. Depending on your permissions, you can add, view, and remove files.
- **File Previews (center)**: Open documents, code, and resources in tabs (e.g., tables, markdown notes, MeshDocuments).
- **Messaging (right)**: Switch between human and agent participants and chat with them. 
- **Developer Console (bottom)**: Real-time debugging tools: 
    - **Logs, Traces, Metrics** to observe startup, tool calls, agent actions, and performance
    - **Images** and **Containers** views to see what’s running in the room.
    - **Terminal** for interactive commands (subject to your permissions).

### Room Menu (upper left)
- **Leave Room**: Exit the Room and return to MeshAgent Studio project view 
- **Run Task**: Invoke a generic task runner (single turn agent) and optionally attach tools to it
- **Toolkits**: View available tools and toolkits in the room and invoke them directly
- **Queues**: View the queues in the rom and number of messages in each queue
- **Database**: Create and update tables
- **Room Services**: View, add, remove, and update services tied to this room (excludes project services)
- **View Toggles**: Show/hide File Browser, File Previews, Messaging, and Developer Console

## Members
Control project access and roles. Use this tab to invite collaborators via email, assign appropriate roles and scopes, and remove members who no longer need access to your project. 

**Roles**: 
- Admin: Full project control, only admins can edit project settings, manage members/roles, and invite/remove users.
- Developer: Build/test permissions without org-level admin power. Developers can perform operational tasks like creating mailboxes and deploying services. 
- Room Creator: Limited role for collaborators who only need to spin up new rooms. Assign this when someone should make rooms but not deploy services, edit secrets, or manage other project resources.

## API Keys
Issue and rotate project‑scoped credentials used by automations, CI, and services that call MeshAgent APIs. You can: 
- Create, relabel, and revoke keys
- Track when a key was created for audiot and rotation

## Services
Services turn your agents, toolkits, or connectors into reusable building blocks. Project-wide services are viewable from the Services tab. Room-scoped services are managed directly on the room they are deployed to either inside the **Room Workspace** view or by clicking the menu button on a room. 

From the **Services** tab you can: 
- Inspect what’s deployed to the project
- Create, update, or remove deployed services
- Change the Room Server Version if you need to pin a project to a specific version of MeshAgent or update it (defaults to latest)

## Secrets
Store configuration securely. Use Secret Keys for app/runtime config and Image Pull Secrets for private registries.
- Create a secret with key/value pairs; secret values never reappear after you leave the page.
- Add image pull secrets to fetch private images. 
- Remove secrets that are no longer needed.

## Webhooks
Webhooks notify your systems when something interesting happens inside MeshAgent:
- Subscribe to events like room started/ended, file updates/file deletes.
- Configure the name, URL, and select event triggers.

## Integrations
Bring your own LLM settings and observability: 

**LLM Router**
- Configure provider credentials and base URLs at the project level (for example OpenAI or Anthropic).
- Services running in rooms can use the room proxy clients to route requests through the router, so you don't need local API keys in your code.

**Telemetry (OTEL)**
- Export room/runtime metrics and traces to your stack by providing an OTEL endpoint and optional bearer token.

## OAuth
Create OAuth2/OIDC clients to enable MeshAgent to sign in for your apps. A client is used to identify a single app to MeshAgent's OAuth servers.  
- Register a client with name, scopes (e.g., openid profile email offline_access), and Redirect URIs (one per line).
- Choose Grant Types (authorization_code, refresh_token, client_credentials) and Response Types (code, token, id_token).

## Usage
Understand cost, performance, and activity at the project level. Usage dashboards include: 
- Active Rooms and Participants trends
- Cost tracking by provider
- Most used tools and rooms to see adoption and activity trends
- Tool call latency for performance turning

## Mail 
Provision room‑scoped mailboxes that agents can read from or send through: 
- Create mailboxes, assign them to rooms, and pick the email address domain provided by MeshAgent
- Map incoming messages to queues so worker agents can process them asynchronously
- Delete mailboxes which are no longer needed

## Billing 
The Billing tab provides credit information and can be used to: 
- View current spend and historical usage
- Purchase credits and enable auto‑reload to prevent interruptions

## Next Steps
- Follow the [Getting Started guide](./get_started) to create your first project and room.
- Use the [CLI quickstarts](../cli/getting_started) to complement what you configure in MeshAgent Studio.
- When you are ready for production, read the [Services deployment docs](../services_room_containers/overview) to package and deploy agents and tools as MeshAgent services.
