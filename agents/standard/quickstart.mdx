MeshAgent Agents are processes that accept input and produce output. In many cases, your agent will be powered by a LLM, but it could also just be code that performs a task. 

There are two primary types of agents, participant-based agents that you can talk to with voice or text, or ambient agents (task runners), both can be extended with tools. The main difference is that the chat and voicebots show up as participants and the conversation threads are persisted vs the ambient agents or task runners are something that you invoke and they do a task and then return the response. 

This walkthrough shows how to: 
- Create a Chatbot
- Call it into a room
- Interact with it from the MeshAgent Studio. 

## Step 1: Create an agent with ``ServiceHost`` 

Let's create a simple ``Chatbot`` that takes a system prompt (rules). 

What is ServiceHost?
``ServiceHost`` is a lightweight HTTP server that allows you to register one or more agent classes on paths (e.g., ``/agent``), and the host automatically exposes them as webhooks. When a room “makes a call” to that path, ``ServiceHost`` handles the handshake, connects the agent to the room, and forwards requests and responses between your code and the MeshAgent infrastructure.

    <Chatbot />
</CodeGroup>


## Step 2: Run the agent locally

```bash bash
python main.py
```

By default, the service listens on ``http://localhost:8081/agent``. Here ``8081`` is the default port, and ``/agent`` is the path we set for our chatbot.


## Step 3: Call the agent into a room
You can call the agent into a MeshAgent room from the CLI

```bash bash
meshagent setup ## authenticate to meshagent
meshagent call agent --url=http://localhost:8081/agent --room=quickstart --participant-name=chatbot
```

After the call, the agent joins the room as participant ``chatbot``. You can now converse with it in [MeshAgent Studio](https://www.studio.meshagent.com).

**Note**: Alternatively, you can run the agent service in one step using the command: 
```bash 
meshagent service run "main.py" --room=quickstart
```

## Step 4: Interact with the Agent 
You can interact with the agent directly from the [MeshAgent Studio UI](https://www.studio.meshagent.com) or from code. 

### Using the agent in the Studio
1. Go to [MeshAgent Studio](https://www.studio.meshagent.com) and login
2. Enter your room ``quickstart``
3. Select the agent ``chatbot`` and begin chatting!

## Room Agents API Overview
The room.agents object lets you invite agents into a room, query who’s already there, and interact with their toolkits directly from code. For more details check out the [Room Agents documentation](../../room_api/agents). Note that these operations work for gathering information from or interacting with services that are running on MeshAgent's infrastructure not your local machine. 

| Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Call](../../room_api/agents#1-call) | Invites an external service (your agent) to join the room. |
| [Ask](../../room_api/agents#2-ask) | Sends a prompt or task to an agent already in the room and returns its answer. |
| [List Agents](../../room_api/agents#4-list-agents) | Lists every agent currently registered in the room with metadata such as name, title, and schemas. |
| [List Toolkits](../../room_api/agents#3-list-toolkits) | Retrieves all toolkits (and their tools) available in the room. |
| [Invoke Tool](../../room_api/agents#5-invoke-tool) | Directly executes a specific tool within a toolkit without routing through an agent. |


## Next Steps
- Add custom rules or toolkits to your agent: 
  - See [Build and Deploy Chatbot](./buildanddeploychatbot) to learn how to add built-in MeshAgent tools (for things like presenting a UI or writing to documents), and custom tools to your chatbot.
  - [TaskRunner](./taskrunner) to learn how to run agents from other agent frameworks, "agents" without an LLM, and more.
  - [Tools Quickstart](../tools/quickstart) to learn how to build custom tools. 
- Deploy your agent as a MeshAgent Service. 
- Explore the broader [Room Agents Client](../../room_api/agents) for more information on listing agents, discovering tools, invoking tools, and more.
