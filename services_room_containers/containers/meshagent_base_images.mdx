title: MeshAgent Base Images
---

MeshAgent publishes base images so you can package and ship agents/services quickly without building every dependency from scratch.

**Where to pull**
- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/meshagent)
- [Google Artifact Registry](https://console.cloud.google.com/artifacts/docker/meshagent-public/us-central1/images)

For faster cold starts, every image has a stargz-optimized variant with an `-esgz` tag (e.g., `meshagent/python-sdk-slim:<tag>-esgz` or `meshagent/cli:{version}-esgz`). If you are building your own container we recommend [creating a stargz-optimized image](./optimizing_containers), this will make it much faster to pull and run your image.

**Image catalog**

| Image | Best for | What’s inside | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `meshagent/cli` | Running or modifying the built-in CLI ChatBot or VoiceBot. Great starting point to set custom rules and add tools to an agent without writing custom code. | Prebuilt `meshagent` binary with all CLI flags | Typically use `meshagent chatbot service ...` or `meshagent voicebot service ...` with applicable flags as your command. |
| `meshagent/python-sdk-slim` | Default Python services. Does not include livekit, so not suitable for voice agents. | Python 3.13 slim + MeshAgent API/Agents/Tools/OpenAI + OTEL; `uv` preinstalled | Recommended starting point for custom Python agents/tools. |
| `meshagent/python-sdk` | Python services needing additional packages (e.g. livekit for voice agents) | Everything in `python-sdk-slim` **plus** LiveKit/audio, MCP, Computers, MarkItDown, etc. | Heavier; use if you need the extended deps out of the box. |
| `meshagent/shell` | Shell-based tools/agents that need common Linux utilities | Python 3.13 slim + MeshAgent SDK + common CLI tools (curl, git, ripgrep, etc.) | Handy for “developer” style agents or shell-based utilities. |
| `meshagent/nodejs-sdk` | JavaScript/TypeScript services | Node 22 + MeshAgent TS SDK workspace scaffold | Bring your own build/start command. |
| `meshagent/dotnet-sdk` | .NET services | Latest .NET SDK + MeshAgent .NET SDK source | Use `dotnet publish` in your Dockerfile stage. |
| `meshagent/flutter` | Flutter UI builds | Flutter SDK + MeshAgent Flutter/Dart workspaces | For building/publishing Flutter-based UIs. |

**Tagging & architectures**
- Tags: `latest`, versioned tags (e.g., `0.8.x`), and stargz variants (`*-esgz`). If you want lazy-pull startup speed, pick the `-esgz` tag; it falls back gracefully if the runtime doesn’t support stargz.
- Platform: images are published for `linux/amd64`.
