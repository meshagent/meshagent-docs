title: Language SDKs
---

MeshAgent ships **official SDKs for Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, Dart (Flutter), and .NET**. Every SDK exposes the Room API for real-time messaging, documents, storage, queues, and tools. Agents are fully available in Python and under active development in the other runtimes; web and mobile SDKs add UI widgets for chat/voice clients.
