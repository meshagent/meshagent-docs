title: REST API
---
import MeshAgentClient from "/snippets/examples/python/rest_api/rest_api_example.mdx"

The MeshAgent REST API exposes administrative and lifecycle operations for projects, rooms, users, permissions, services, storage, billing, sessions, and integrations.

The REST API can be used for: 
- **Projects & Rooms**: Create projects, manage rooms, and mint room connection tokens  
- **Room grants** : Persist per-user permissions to manage participant access and available actions
- **Project storage**: Upload/download project files by path  
- **Services**: Manage project-wide and room-scoped services
- **Secrets**: Manage key-based and image-pull secrets  
- **Integrations**: Manage webhooks, API keys, OAuth clients
- **Shares**: Create share links for Rooms
- **Mailboxes**: Manage mailboxes mapped to Rooms
- **Operations**: Understand sessions (events/spans/metrics) and create/manage scheduled tasks  
- **Billing & usage**: Get insight into your account balance, transactions, subscriptions, and usage reporting

For room-specific operations such as working with agents, databases, or queues use the [Room APIs](../room_api/overview).

## Getting started

To call the MeshAgent REST API, authenticate with a project API key. The simplest path is:

1) **Set up a Python environment** with the MeshAgent SDK installed (requires Python 3.13)
2) **Use the MeshAgent CLI to create and activate an API key**, then store it in a `.env`  file
3) **Load the key from `.env`** and create a `Meshagent()` client

> MeshAgent requires **Python 3.13**. We recommend using `uv`, which manages Python versions, virtual environments, and dependencies automatically. To learn more about `uv` see the [Machine Setup Guide for Python](../reference/machine_setup)

### 1. Set up the SDK

Install uv, then create a project and virtual environment with MeshAgent installed:

```bash
# Install uv if needed
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh 

# Create and navigate to your project directory
mkdir meshagent-project && cd meshagent-project 

# Initialize the project and pin Python 3.13 
uv init --python 3.13

# Create virtual environment (uv will download python 3.13 if not already installed on your machine)
uv venv --python 3.13

# Install MeshAgent SDK and other dependencies
uv add "meshagent[all]" python-dotenv
```

Activate your virtual environment:
<CodeGroup>
```bash macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```
```bash Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
</CodeGroup>

> **Note**: You'll know your virtual environment is active when you see `(.venv)` at the start of your terminal prompt. When the environment is activated, you can run commands directly (e.g. `meshagent setup` or `python main.py`). If the environment is not activated, prefix commands with `uv run` (e.g. `uv run meshagent setup` or `uv run python main.py`). 

To upgrade dependencies later, run:
```bash 
uv lock --upgrade
uv sync
```

### 2. Create a new API key and store it in `.env`

```bash
# Authenticate to MeshAgent if not already signed in
meshagent setup # this will also print your project ID

# Get your current project ID
meshagent project list # the project with the * next to it is the current active project

# Create an API Key
meshagent api-key create --activate my-key
```

Create a `.env` file in your project and paste the key value:

```bash
MESHAGENT_API_KEY=your-api-key-value
MESHAGENT_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
```

### 3. Create a MeshAgent client
Now we can create the MeshAgent client and use it to do something like list all the rooms in our project. 

<CodeGroup>
     <MeshAgentClient />
</CodeGroup>

### Client configuration
The `Meshagent()` client accepts a `base_url` and `token`.
- `base_url`: defaults to `MESHAGENT_API_URL` (defaults to https://api.meshagent.com)
- `token`: a bearer token for the Authorization header. 
    - This will default to `MESHAGENT_API_KEY`. API keys are scoped to a specific project, so most REST calls will also require a `project_id`.

Every method raises `meshagent.api.RoomException` on non-2xx responses and validates responses with Pydantic models, so malformed payloads surface as rich errors.

## Projects & Rooms
Create and manage projects and Rooms. Room connection returns a signed token and a room URL to join the room.

## Room grants
Room grants store per-user permissions (`ApiScope`s) for a specific room. They are persisted as `ProjectRoomGrant { room, user_id, permissions }` records and are used when minting room connection tokens (see [participant tokens](./participant_tokens)).
