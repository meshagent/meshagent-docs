Supabase is an open-source backend platform that provides a hosted Postgres database, auth, storage, and realtime APIs. The Supabase MCP server exposes these capabilities as tools that can be used in MeshAgent.

In this guide you'll learn how to:
- Create a Supabase account and access token
- Quick start: Install a pre-built Supabase toolkit into Powerboards in minutes
- Build and customize: Connect, test, and deploy the Supabase MCP server using the MeshAgent CLI

## Supabase Setup (required for both paths)
1. Create a Supabase account and a project at https://supabase.com. 
2. From the Project Settings -> General page you will see the Project ID (also called Project Reference). You will use this value to connect MeshAgent to your Supabase project. 
3. Create a Supabase access token. Go to [Account Settings -> Access Tokens](https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens). Generate a new token and set an expiration date for it. Keep this value private.

> **Note**: Each MCP connection is scoped to a single Supabase project. If you need to connect multiple projects, repeat the steps below with a different project reference and toolkit name.

## Quickstart: Install via Powerboards
If you want to get up and running without using the MeshAgent CLI, you can install the Supabase toolkit directly into [Powerboards](https://app.powerboards.com). 

1. Click the link below to open the supabase toolkit installer: [Install Supabase Toolkit in Powerboards]().
2. Powerboards will walk you through the setup, you will sign in, create/select a Project, create/select a room, then install the toolkit. You will need to paste in your Supabase Project ID and Supabase Access Token you generated above. Powerboards will automatically store the access token as a secret. 
3. Next, click the link to install an agent that uses the toolkit: [Install Agent that Uses Supabase Toolkit in Powerboards]().
4. Follow the same process to install the agent. 

Once installed, the Supabase toolkit will be available in your room. Any agent in the room with access to the toolkit can use it to interact with your Supabase project.

## Build and Customize: CLI Guide 
This path walks you through connecting and testing the Supabase MCP server locally, then deploying it as a persistent service. This is useful if you want to customize the toolkit, test changes before deploying, or understand how the pre-built Powerboards template works under the hood.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have:
- The [MeshAgent CLI](../cli/getting_started) installed (either a global install e.g. `brew install meshagent` or in a python environment `uv add "meshagent[all]"`) and connected to the MeshAgent project you want to work in (run `meshagent setup` then select your project).
- Room admin access to the room you plan to use. (How to check this? Or do it in the studio?)
- A participant token with `api.secrets` and `api.admin` grants (this is granted by...)

### Step 1: Export your credentials
Export your Supabase credentials so the following commands can reference them:

```bash bash 
export SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF="your_project_ref"
export SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_access_token"
```

### Step 2: Store the access token as a room secret
Create a room-scoped secret so the MCP server can authenticate with Supabase. This stores your access token under the secret ID `supabase` and makes it available to the `supabase` identity (this is the identity we'll use for the toolkit).

```bash bash
meshagent setup # authenticate to MeshAgent if not already signed in

meshagent room secrets set \
  --room myroom \
  --secret-id supabase \
  --name supabase \
  --for-identity supabase \
  --text "$SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

> **Note** Running this command requires you to be authenticated to MeshAgent with a token that has both `api.secrets` and `api.admin` grants because you are setting a secret for another identity. You must also be a room admin to set secrets for a room.

### Step 3: Start the MCP Session 
This command connects to the Supabase MCP server and exposes it as a toolkit in your room. The `{supabase}` placeholder in `--header-secret` resolves to the room secret you created in Step 2 (matching the `--secret-id supabase`).

The `project_ref` parameter in the URL determines which Supabase project this toolkit can access. Agents or humans using this toolkit will only be able to interact with that specific project.

```bash bash
meshagent mcp http \
  --room myroom \
  --toolkit-name supabase \
  --url "https://mcp.supabase.com/mcp?project_ref=$SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF" \
  --header-secret "Authorization:Bearer {supabase}" 
```

This will print an output like 

```
Connecting to room...
INFO:mcp.client.streamable_http:Received session ID: ...
```

**How can I see the MCP toolkit?** 

Open a new terminal tab then run: 
```bash bash
meshagent setup # authenticate and connect to the same project
meshagent room agents list-toolkits --room myroom
```

You should see the supabase toolkit listed along with all its available tools. You can also verify in [MeshAgent Studio](https://studio.meshagent.com). Navigate to `myroom`, open the menu in the upper left, and select **Toolkits**. You will see the **supabase** toolkit and its associated tools. 

### Step 4: Test with an agent
With the MCP session still running in your first terminal tab, from a second tab in your terminal start a chatbot agent that uses the Supabase toolkit:

```bash bash
meshagent chatbot join \
  --room myroom \
  --agent-name supabase-agent \
  --require-toolkit supabase \
  --web-search \
  --room-rules "agents/supabase-agent/rules.txt" \
  --rule "You are an agent who helps users work with Supabase. Use the Supabase toolkit to interact with a specific Supabase project. If the web search tool is enabled, you can search the web to learn more about the latest updates to Supabase."
```

Try it out in [MeshAgent Studio](https://studio.meshagent.com): 
1. Enter `myroom` 
2. Select the **supabase-agent** from the participants list
3. Ask the agent to perform a task, such as listing tables in your Supabase project.
4. Optionally, click the + button and enable **Web Search** to let the agent look up Supabase documentation on the fly.

Now that you've tried it in MeshAgent Studio you can deploy the supabase toolkit and accompanying agent.

### Step 5: Deploy the Supabase toolkit as a persistent service
Once you've verified everything works locally, you can deploy the Supabase toolkit as a persistent service so the toolkit stays available without a local terminal session.

Create a ServiceTemplate configuration file, `meshagent.yaml`, that defines the service:

<CodeGroup>
  <MCPSupabaseYAML />
</CodeGroup>

Deploy the service template:

```bash bash
meshagent service create-template \
  --file "meshagent.yaml" \
  --value supabase_project_ref=$SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF \
  --room myroom
```

> Warning: This command will deploy the service, but if the room secret does not exist the container will exit with `Secret 'supabase' not found` and the toolkit will not register.

After deployment, the Supabase toolkit will be available to any participant or agent in the room without a local MCP session.

To deploy the chatbot that uses the toolkit run: 

```bash bash 
meshagent chatbot deploy \
  --service-name supabase-agent \
  --room myroom \
  --agent-name supabase-agent \
  --require-toolkit supabase \
  --web-search \
  --room-rules "agents/supabase-agent/rules.txt" \
  --rule "You are an agent who helps users work with Supabase. Use the Supabase toolkit to interact with a specific Supabase project. If the web search tool is enabled, you can search the web to learn more about the latest updates to Supabase."
```

### Publishing to Powerboards
Once you're happy with your service template, you can make it installable via Powerboards so others can use it without going through the CLI steps.
1. Push your `meshagent.yaml` to a GitHub Gist (or any publicly accessible URL).
2. Click the Raw button on the gist to get the direct URL to the file.
3. Construct the Powerboards install link: https://app.powerboards.com/install?url=YOUR_RAW_URL

Anyone who clicks that link will be able to install the toolkit into their own room — Powerboards handles secret creation and configuration for them.

> Powerboards note: the ServiceTemplate includes a `supabase_access_token` variable with `meshagent.secret.*` annotations. Powerboards uses that to prompt for the token and store the room secret automatically. The CLI ignores those annotations, so you still need to set the room secret yourself before deploying the toolkit that uses the service from the command line.
