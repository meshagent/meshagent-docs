MeshAgent emits OpenTelemetry signals out of the box. When you need deeper insight, you can add your own spans, logs, and metrics using standard OTEL SDKs. This guide walks through a Weather Toolkit with custom intstrumentation so you can see the pieces in action. 

## Enable telemetry in your service
Add two lines at startup before you create your ``ServiceHost``: 

```python Python
from meshagent.otel import otel_config
otel_config(service_name="weather-service")
```

This initializes tracing, logging, and metrics and tags everything with your project/room/session so it shows up live in MeshAgent Studio.

## Example: Weather Toolkit with custom instrumentation
The example adds custom spans around validation, the external HTTP call, and response parsing. It also adds logs and metrics.

    <OtelExample />

### Custom Spans
Use spans to track a specific operation in trace. Spans can help you understand timing for each step and attach attributes/events to make debugging easier.

This example records: 
- ``toolkit.execute`` (created by MeshAgent) this is the high-level tool call including information about which tool was called and what information was passed to the tool
    - `validate_input` – checks city/units, adds events for pass/fail
    - `fetch_weather_api` – the external HTTP call with:
        - `http.url`, `http.method`, `http.status_code`, `http.response_size`
        - events like `api_request_start`, `api_request_success`, `api_timeout`, `rate_limit_exceeded`
    - `parse_response` – extracts the fields you return to the caller

Capturing additional information inside the (span/trace) created by MeshAgent allows us to capture finer-grained information about our process. 

**Pattern:**
```python Python
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.trace import Status, StatusCode

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)
with tracer.start_as_current_span("fetch_weather_api") as span:
    span.set_attribute("http.url", api_url)
    span.add_event("api_request_start")
    ...
    if resp.status_code == 429:
        span.set_status(Status(StatusCode.ERROR, "Rate limited"))
```
These show up in the room’s **Traces** tab.

### Custom Logs
``otel_config()`` sets up an OTEL logging handler so your normal logging.info() lines are captured. Add extra logs to make it easier to debug and understand...

```python Python
import logging
log = logging.getLogger(__name__)

log.info(f"Weather tool is running for city: {city} with units: {units}")
```

These show up in the room’s **Logs** tab.

### Custom Metrics
You can also add additional counters and historgrams to help track trends over time.

```python Python
from opentelemetry import metrics
meter = metrics.get_meter("weather.tools")

calls = meter.create_counter("weather.calls", unit="1",
                             description="Total weather tool invocations")

# When a call starts
calls.add(1, attributes={"city": city.lower(), , "units": units})
```

These show up in the room’s **Metrics** tab.

## Running the sample
You can run this toolkit as a service and invoke the weather tool, `get_weather()`, from Studio or the CLI.

### Step 1: Creating the room service 
First build and push the container, then add the service to your room. You'll need a ``Dockerfile`` and ``meshagent.yaml`` file to do so. 

```Dockerfile Dockerfile
FROM "meshagent/python-sdk-slim:latest"

WORKDIR /src
RUN python3 -m pip install --no-cache-dir httpx
COPY . /src

ENTRYPOINT [ "python3", "main.py" ] 
```

```yaml yaml
kind: ServiceTemplate
version: v1
metadata:
  name: otel-example
  description: "An example weather tool with otel instrumentation"
ports:
- num: "*"
  liveness: "/"
  endpoints:
  - path: /weather
    identity: weather-toolkit
    type: meshagent.callable
container: 
  image: "YOUR_IMAGE_DETAILS" #example: myregistry/otel-example:0.0.1
  command: python3 main.py

```

Once you've built and pushed the container, add the service to a room using the MeshAgent Studio UI: 
1. Click the menu icon for the room --> **Services** --> **New Service**
2. Fill in name, image details, and port details. For **Ports** you can put `*` to let MeshAgent assign an available port.
    - Add the port endpoint information e.g. Port Type: `meshagent.callable`, Endpoint: `/weather`, Participant Name" `weather-toolkit`. 
4. Create the service

### Step 2: Invoking the tool 
Once you've created the service you can invoke the tool directly from MeshAgent Studio by going into the room, clicking the menu icon, selecting **Toolkits**, then select the **Weather Tool** and click **Invoke**. The UI will display a dialog for you to input the city and units you want to get the weather from. 

You can also invoke the tool using the MeshAgent CLI:

```bash bash 
meshagent agents invoke-tool \
  --room=otel \
  --toolkit=weather-toolkit \
  --tool=get_weather \
  --arguments='{"city":"Costa Mesa","units":"imperial"}'
```

## Viewing telemetry 
From [MeshAgent Studio](https://studio.meshagent.com) you will see Logs, Traces, and Metrics both from the **Session** view of the room and from the **Developer Console**. The **Session** viewer provides a focused view of session details which are accessible during and after each session. The **Developer Console** appears on the lower part of the screen once you're inside a room and shows live traces, logs, and metrics as you interact with your services inside a room.

After invoking the weather tool in this example you should see a trace tree appear in the **Traces** tab with a structure like this: 

```
toolkit.execute (get_weather)
 ├─ validate_input
 ├─ fetch_weather_api
 └─ parse_response
```

Applicable logs and metrics will appear under their respective tabs.
