description: Learn what MeshAgent UI SDKs provide and how they help you bring agent experiences into your app quickly.
---

MeshAgent UI SDKs give you drop-in building blocks for bringing agent-powered experiences to your own product. They handle the real-time wiring to rooms and documents, stream updates from your agents, and ship with UI components so your users get a polished interface from day one. 

## What we ship today

- **React UI kit (web)**: A set of React components and hooks for rendering chat threads, streaming responses, and presence indicators, along with Tailwind styles so you can start building your agentic applications today. Explore the code on GitHub for the [React UI kit](https://github.com/meshagent/meshagent-react) and [Tailwind styles](https://github.com/meshagent/meshagent-tailwind).
- **Flutter UI kit (mobile & desktop)**: Widgets like `RoomConnectionScope` and `DocumentConnectionScope` that manage real-time connections for you and expose builder APIs so you can compose your own layouts.

## Why use the UI SDKs?

- **Faster launches**: Start with prebuilt chat, document, and voice surfaces instead of implementing messaging, streaming, and retries yourself.
- **Less plumbing**: Connection scopes, auth helpers, and sensible defaults keep you focused on your UX while the SDKs handle room lifecycles and state updates.
- **Built for growth**: Extend components with your own styling, add custom tools, and reuse the same back-end agents across platforms.

## Pick your path

Choose the UI SDK that matches your stack, then drop its components into your app:

1. Use the **React UI kit** when you want a web-first experience with Tailwind-ready components.
2. Use the **Flutter UI kit** when you need a single codebase across iOS, Android, desktop, or embedded form factors.

Both SDKs connect to the same rooms, documents, and agents you manage in MeshAgent Studio, so you can prototype in minutes and ship a production-ready UI with minimal effort.

MeshAgent provides room/document clients you can drop into UI frameworks. Use the platform you prefer, and wire in the Room client to connect, sync documents, and react to events.
