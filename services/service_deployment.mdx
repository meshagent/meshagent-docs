title: Service Deployment
---

Once you've built and tested your service locally, you're ready to deploy it so others can use it. MeshAgent offers **two deployment options: project-wide services that are available to all rooms in your project, or room-specific services for specialized workflows**.

## Deployment Options

### Project-Wide Services
Deploy once and make your service available to all rooms in your project. Perfect for:
- Shared agents that multiple teams use
- Common tools and utilities
- Organization-wide integrations
- Services that should be consistently available

### Room-Specific Services (using Containers API)
Run directly to individual rooms for specialized use cases. Ideal for:
- Experimental or prototype services
- Running ad-hoc processes inside a Room
- Services that analyze activities across multiple rooms

## What You Need
Before deploying ensure you have: 
- **Source code** with ``ServiceHost`` setup
- **Dockerfile** that builds your service
- **meshagent.yaml** ServiceTemplate configuration (not needed if deploying a project-wide service through MeshAgent Studio UI or if you want to specify all the config options through the MeshAgent CLI)
- **Container image** (built and pushed to a registry) OR **Git repository** with Dockerfile, source code, and meshagent.yaml (for room-specific deployments)

## Deploying a Project-Wide Service
You can deploy a project-wide service from the MeshAgent Studio UI or using the MeshAgent CLI. In either case you first need to build and push your docker container somewhere you can access it. 

```bash bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t your-registry/your-service:v1 . --push
```

**Note**: We recommend using buildx with --platform linux/amd64 to ensure your image works correctly in MeshAgent's infrastructure, regardless of whether you're building on Intel or ARM (Apple Silicon) machines.

### Using MeshAgent Studio UI
1. Navigate to [studio.meshagent.com](https://studio.meshagent.com)
2. Select your project
3. Click the **Services Tab** and click **New Service**
4. Fill in the applicable information including the name, role, the image details, command to run the container, port information (including number, meshagent.callable type, path, and liveness check), and a room storage path if applicable (/data). 

Once you fill in these details the service you created will be available inside all of the rooms in your project, simply start a new room and the service will appear. 

### Using the MeshAgent CLI
For automated deployments or CI/CD workflows you can use the MeshAgent CLI: 

For example using the chatbot defined in the [Service Configuration](./service_configuration) example we could deploy it from the MeshAgent CLI using the following commands: 

```bash bash
# Authenticate
meshagent setup

# Deploy project-wide service from container image with additional configuration
meshagent service create \
  --name my-chatbot \
  --image your-registry/chatbot:v1 \
  --role agent \
  --env "SYSTEM_PROMPT=You are a helpful assistant" \
  --port "num=* type=meshagent.callable liveness=/ path=/agent participant_name=chatbot"

# Deploy from ServiceTemplate file
meshagent service create --file meshagent.yaml --image your-registry/chatbot:v1
```
