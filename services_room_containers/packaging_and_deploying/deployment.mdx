title: Deploying Services
---

After you've [packaged your service](./packaging), you're ready to deploy it. Services can be deployed at the project level (available in every room) or the room level (scoped to a specific room). Both types of services will start and stop with the room's lifecycle; however, room services will also automatically update if changed during the room's session while project service updates require the room to restart for the change to take effect. 

## Prerequisites 
To deploy a MeshAgent service you will need: 
- Service configuration file (`kind: Service` or `kind: ServiceTemplate`)
- For containerized services:
    - Dockerfile
    - Container image pushed to a registry (linux/amd64 recommended for compatibility)
    - [Secrets and image pull secrets](/secrets/secrets_overview) if applicable 
- For external services:
    - URL where your service is already running

## Deploy a Service using the MeshAgent CLI
For automated deployments or CI/CD workflows, use the MeshAgent CLI. Once you run the commands the service will be deployed. The next time you start a room, the service will automatically start when the room starts and stop when the room stops.

### Deploy a Project Service

```bash bash
meshagent setup # authenticate if not already signed in
meshagent service create --file meshagent.yaml 
```

### Deploy a Room Service
```bash bash
meshagent setup # authenticate if not already signed in
meshagent service create --file meshagent.yaml --room=myroom
```

### Update an Existing Service
If you make modifications to your service, you can easily update it using the MeshAgent CLI. 

```bash bash
meshagent service update --file meshagent.yaml  # add --room=myroom for room services
```

## Deploy from MeshAgent Studio
You can deploy and update services from the MeshAgent Studio UI. Once the service is created, you can edit them in the UI and save the changes. 

### Deploy a Project Service
1. Visit [studio.meshagent.com](https://studio.meshagent.com) and select your project
2. Select the **Services** tab and choose **New Service**
3. Provide the required information:  
    - Service name and description
    - Container Image details or external URL 
    - Port configuration and endpoints
    - Environment variables, secrets, and storage (if applicable) 
4. Save the configuration

Once saved, the service will be available to all the rooms in your project. The next time any room session starts, the project service will start in that room.

### Deploy a Room Service 
1. Visit [studio.meshagent.com](https://studio.meshagent.com) and open a specific room
2. Select the menu icon on a room then **Services** then click **New Service**
3. Provide the required information 
4. Save the configuration

Once saved, the service will be available in this room and start the next time the room starts. If the service is updated during the session, MeshAgent will automatically update the service so it stays in sync with what is saved.

## Verify Deployment

To verify your service is running you can open your room from [studio.meshagent.com](https://studio.meshagent.com) and check session logs for any startup logs from your service. For containerized services you can open the developer console in the room and check the **Containers** tab. Your should see the status of your container, the image name, and that it was started by MeshAgent.
