## Overview

MeshAgent is an **end to end platform** for building, deploying, and hosting AI Agents. MeshAgent 
integrates AI Agents and human teams in real time by bundling LLM orchestration, tool integration, real-time messaging, observability, and deployment so you can ship and share agents in minutes instead of weeks. 

### Prerequisites 

Before you start, make sure your machine matches the appropriate requirements. If youâ€™ve *never* set up Python, pip, or uv before, follow the [**Machine Setup Guide**](../reference/machine_setup) first, then return here.

### Key Concepts
- **Projects**: Groups related Rooms and the Agents that serve them. It is best to create a different Project for each use case.
- **Rooms**: A dedicated space for humans and Agents to collaborate in real time. 
- **Agents**: ChatBots, VoiceBots, TaskRunners, and Workers that you build and deploy with custom tools or out of the box MeshAgent tools. Once deployed, Agents are automatically available in every Room under that Project. 


### In this guide you will learn how to:
1. Create a MeshAgent account and project in MeshAgent Studio
2. Install MeshAgent for Python
3. Connect to your first MeshAgent Room and call a chat and voice agent into your room

## Setup Guide
### Step 1: Create an account and project:

1. In a browser, go to [meshagent.com](https://www.meshagent.com/). Sign into MeshAgent Studio with an existing account or sign up for an new account. 
2. In the web ui, if necessary, create a new project and give it a name (e.g., MyProject)
3. Ensure your project has credits to start a room. Go to the Billing page to check your credits in the project.


### Step 2: Install MeshAgent
First navigate to your project and activate your virtual environment, for help with this see our [Machine Setup Guide](../reference/machine_setup).

Once your virtual environment is activated, install MeshAgent using the Python package manager of your choice. 

<CodeGroup>
```bash uv
uv add 'meshagent[all]' 
```
```bash pip
pip install meshagent[all]
```
</CodeGroup>

**Note**: Installing the entire MeshAgent SDK as shown above automatically installs the MeshAgent CLI package, but the CLI can also be installed independently using ``uv add meshagent-cli`` or ``pip install meshagent-cli``.


### Step 3: Use the MeshAgent CLI to Connect to a Project

Authenticate and activate a project. 

<CodeGroup>
```bash bash
# A browser window will open for OAUTH.
meshagent setup
```
</CodeGroup>

__Optional__: Alternatively, instead of running the `meshagent setup` command you can run:

<CodeGroup>
```bash bash
# A browser window will open for OAUTH.
meshagent auth login
meshagent project activate -i
meshagent api-key activate -i
```
</CodeGroup>

You are now authenticated and ready to use the cli to perform operations involving a room. 


### Step 4: Call an agent into a room using the MeshAgent CLI

To call a chat agent into the room run: 

```sh
meshagent chatbot join --room gettingstarted --agent-name chatagent --name chatagent
```

The chatbot is now connected to the "gettingstarted" Room. 

In a web browser, go to [studio.meshagent.com](https://studio.meshagent.com/) and join the "gettingstarted" session. In the participants tab you will see the "chatagent" participant appear. To talk to the agent, just select it from the participants list and begin chatting! 

Next, to call a voice agent into the room run: 
```sh
meshagent voicebot join --room gettingstarted --agent-name voiceagent --name voiceagent
```

Go back to [studio.meshagent.com](https://studio.meshagent.com/) and go to the "gettingstarted" room where you'll now see the voiceagent. To talk to the voice agent, select it from the participants tab and begin speaking. We recommend clicking the mute button once you are done talking so the agent does not get interrupted by any potential background noise near you. 

## Next Steps

To learn more about the MeshAgent CLI for managing rooms and agents from your terminal checkout the [CLI Quickstart](../cli/getting_started). 

To build your first chat or voice agent with tools check out the [Build and Deploy a Chat Agent](../agents/standard/buildanddeploychatbot) and [Build and Deploy a Voice Agent](../agents/standard/buildanddeployvoicebot) guides.
