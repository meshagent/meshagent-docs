# MeshAgent
[MeshAgent](https://www.meshagent.com) is the **application platform built for agentic AI from the ground up**. It gives teams one place to **build, deploy, and operate production AI applications collaboratively, securely, and at any scale**.  

MeshAgent **removes the infrastructure headaches of real-time, multi-player agent collaboration** by provisioning secure Rooms prewired with storage, database access, authentication, and more so humans, agents, and tools can collaborate in real time over shared context. Paired with a developer-friendly SDK, a browser-based [Studio](https://studio.meshagent.com), and a fully-managed Cloud service (MeshAgent Server), MeshAgent lets you ship production agent apps faster with governance and visibility built-in.

Any conversational agents deployed with MeshAgent can be used immediately in [Powerboards](https://www.powerboards.com/). Powerboards is an open-source AI-native app built entirely on MeshAgent. You can use it as-is to share your agents today, or adapt it into your own MeshAgent-powered application.

## Why MeshAgent in 30 seconds
- **Not another agent framework — a complete platform**: Build complete applications, not just agents. MeshAgent provides the runtime, deployment system, scaling infrastructure, and control plane you need for production.
- **Multi-player by design**: Real AI applications need humans and agents working as a team, not isolated bots. Rooms let multiple people and agents share context, coordinate work, and hand off tasks seamlessly.
- **Everything you need, out of the box**:  MeshAgent provides built-in APIs for everything agents need to run, including database access, storage, messaging, queues, containers, and secrets, so you can concentrate on creating valuable agents instead of wiring infrastructure.
- **Operate with confidence**: Built-in tracing, cost breakdowns, and granular permissions give you complete visibility and control over your AI applications.

## Core Components

| Component | What it does | Typical use |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **MeshAgent SDKs** | Language clients ([Python](https://pypi.org/project/meshagent/), [TypeScript/JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@meshagent/meshagent), [Dart](https://pub.dev/documentation/meshagent/latest/), [.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Meshagent.Api)) that wrap Rooms, agents, messaging, storage, queue APIs and more. | Code your agent and call platform services with a few lines of code. |
| **MeshAgent Studio** | [Browser workspace](https://studio.meshagent.com) + CLI for prototyping, testing tools, evaluating agents, and inviting teammates into live Rooms. | Iterate quickly and gather feedback throughout agent development and deployment. |
| **MeshAgent Server** | Managed backend that hosts agents, provisions secure Rooms, scales infrastructure, and exposes usage & billing dashboards. | Run agents in production without maintaining underlying infrastructure. |

## The MeshAgent Difference
Agent frameworks help you prototype agents quickly, but leave you to figure out: 
- How to scale beyond your laptop
- Where to store data and files
- How to deploy and version agents
- How to track costs and debug issues
- How to connect multiple agents and human participants as a collaborative team

MeshAgent gives you everything in one place: 

**Rooms** are secure, on-demand workspaces that spin up when the first participant joins and retire automatically when the last leaves. Within a Room you can:
- **Register agents** (chat, voice, task/background) **and tools** (built-in, custom, or MCP)
- **Use built-in APIs**: database, storage, messaging, queues, secrets, services/containers
- **Invite teammates** to collaborate in real-time from Studio or your app
- **Observe** every message, tool call, latency, and cost with streaming logs & traces

**Plus:**
- **Agent templates**: Pre-built conversational or single-turn worker agents (or bring existing agents from your framework of choice)
- **Easy deployment**: Package and deploy agents, tools, or any code as a service (project-wide or room-specific)
- **Governance controls**: Granular permissions for every participant and service
- **Multi-language support**: Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Dart, .NET are all supported so you can build in your language of choice and support multi-language applications with ease.

## Why Teams Choose MeshAgent
MeshAgent handles the complex infrastructure of running collaborative AI agents, so your teams can focus on building solutions that grow your business.

### Collaborate in Secure Rooms
**The problem:** Building collaborative AI apps requires more than just agents! These apps need databases, file storage, authentication, real-time sync, message queues, and more, but these features are usually stitched together across many services.

**MeshAgent's solution:** Rooms are secure, on‑demand workspaces where people, agents, and tools share context. Each Room includes built‑in APIs:
- **Database API** — Store and query structured data
- **Storage API** — File upload, download, and management
- **Messaging API** — Real-time chat between humans and agents
- **Queues API** — Async task distribution and agent coordination
- **Secrets API** — Secure credential and OAuth token management
- **Sync API** — Real-time collaborative document editing
- **Agents API** — Invoke agents and tools programmatically
- **Containers API** — Run ad-hoc code execution on demand

Rooms automatically provision when the first participant joins, retire when the last one leaves, and scale as demand changes.

### Accelerate Time to Value
**The problem:** Slow feedback loops hinder agent and application development. Testing agents often requires technical setup, and sharing progress with non-technical stakeholders is challenging without giving them an actual application to use. 

**MeshAgent's solution:** MeshAgent Studio brings everyone together for real-time collaboration:
- Spin up a Room in MeshAgent Studio and invite teammates
- Test agents instantly in any browser — no code checkouts, IDEs, or local setup required
- Iterate in parallel - engineers can update logic on the fly as stakeholders interact with an agent. At the same time, front-end teams can focus on building the UI for your agent app
- Deploy as a project or room service when ready and invite teammates back to your session

### Treat Agents as Team Members
**The problem**: Most platforms treat agents differently from humans, forcing teams to maintain separate stacks and duplicate features across both.

**MeshAgent's solution**: Agents are first-class participants in Rooms, just like humans:
- Same permission model (API Scopes work for both)
- Seamless communication patterns (messaging, document sync)
- Same observability (track agent and human actions, tool calls, etc.)
- Seamless handoffs between humans and agents

### Package and Deploy Services Easily
**The problem:** Teams need an easy way to move from prototype to production without rewriting agent, tool, or service logic. 

**MeshAgent's solution:** Services make it easy to package agents, tools, or external connections quickly
- Test locally first — Use `ServiceHost` and the MeshAgent CLI to run your service in a Room locally before deploying
- Built-in integrations — Native support for MCP Servers and OpenAI Connectors, plus prebuilt toolkits for common tasks
- Flexible deployment — Deploy as a project service (available to all Rooms) or room service (scoped to specific rooms)

### Enterprise Grade Governance
**The problem:** Production AI apps needs fine-grained access controls defining who can join which rooms and what operations they can perform.

**MeshAgent's solution:** Built-in permission system at every level:
- Room access control — Define who can join which rooms
- Participant permissions (API Scopes) — Lock down what operations humans/agents can perform (e.g., can read storage but not write)
- Service permissions — Control what deployed services can access (e.g., agent can use storage but not containers)
- Project vs. Room scoping — expose services broadly or to specific Rooms

### Enterprise Grade Observability & Cost Management
**The problem:** Debugging agents requires tracking prompts, tool calls, latency, errors, and costs across distributed systems.

**MeshAgent's solution:** Streaming logs and OpenTelemetry traces capture everything automatically and roll up to project-level insights:
- Automatically record every prompt, tool call, and result 
- Latency histograms and real-time error tracking
- Per-agent cost attribution
- Usage and billing views break down minutes and credits by project, Room, provider, and agent

No middleware to configure — just open MeshAgent Studio and see what's happening.

### Works with Your Stack 
**The Problem**: AI apps often require multiple languages and runtimes to support different use cases and team expertise. Plus, you may have agents built using many different frameworks.

**MeshAgent's Solution**: 
- Official SDKs for Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Dart/Flutter, and .NET.
- UI starters when you want them — React/Tailwind web chat widget and Flutter chat/voice widgets, or bring your own components on top of the Room client.
- Cross-language collaboration — A TypeScript UI, Python agent, and .NET/Go service work together in one Room with no custom adapters.
- Bring your existing agents — Use agents from Pydantic AI, CrewAI, etc. alongside MeshAgent's built-in agents.
