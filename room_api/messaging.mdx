`MessagingClient` enables sending messages between participants and agents in a room, as well as handling streaming messages (`MessageStreamWriter` and `MessageStreamReader`).

---

## Overview

Messaging is a cornerstone of any application that involves dynamic collaboration—whether that collaboration happens between two people, two software agents, or a mix of both. By layering real-time messaging capabilities on top of your existing MeshAgent-powered infrastructure, you gain the flexibility to handle an extensive variety of use cases—from a simple text-based chat between human users to a sophisticated communication pipeline where AI-driven agents and humans collaborate to accomplish tasks. 

---

### Why Messaging?

1. **Real-time collaboration**  
   Effective collaboration happens in real time. The Messaging API allows participants—be they humans or agents—to exchange messages instantly. This immediacy is essential for systems that demand quick feedback loops, like interactive help desk solutions, live analytics dashboards, or agent-based problem solving.

2. **Uniform interface for agents and humans**  
   The Messaging API treats all participants the same, regardless of whether they’re powered by artificial intelligence or controlled by a human. A single, consistent abstraction lowers the complexity of real-time, multi-user applications. You focus on creating features; the API handles participant states, message routing, and attachment handling.

3. **Structured data exchange**  
   Our Messaging API supports sending JSON-based messages and optional binary attachments. This makes it easy to share structured data, multimedia files, or AI model outputs. Instead of rolling your own data-transmission system, you can rely on standardized endpoints and message formats.

4. **Broadcast and point-to-point**  
   Send targeted messages to a single participant or simultaneously reach everyone in a room. This flexibility simplifies building features like announcements, shared notifications, team-based workflows, or private agent-human DM channels.

5. **Extendable via Streams**  
   For more advanced scenarios—like sending large files or streaming partial updates—the Messaging API provides a streaming protocol. Your agents can pass chunks of data incrementally, maintaining a continuous exchange without blocking the rest of your system.

---

## Core Features

### Participant Model
Any entity in a room—human or agent—gets represented by a `Participant`. Each `Participant` has a unique identifier and can be addressed individually for one-on-one interactions, or collectively for broadcasts. This single abstraction unifies how you approach messaging, so your app doesn’t need separate code paths for humans vs. agents.

### JSON-Powered Messages
Your messages can include arbitrary JSON data, which makes them easy to parse and manipulate. Whether you’re sending a text prompt to an AI agent, user profile updates, or a command to start a workflow, JSON-serialization keeps your messages compatible across the entire system.

### Optional Attachments
In addition to JSON, you can attach binary data directly to a message. This is especially useful for file uploads, voice notes, images, or model outputs that need to be transferred as raw bytes.

### Stream Communication
When your application requires transferring large or continuous data—like audio/video streams, logs, or sensor outputs—Streams help you break the data into manageable chunks, while preserving the real-time nature of the exchange.

### Event-Driven Architecture
Register event handlers for specific message types so your application logic reacts immediately. For example, you can trigger a follow-up task whenever an agent returns a particular response, or display a system notification any time a participant updates their attributes.




- **`MessagingClient`** – A high-level client that:
  - Sends and receives messages between room participants
  - Manages stream-based messages via `createStream()`
  - Tracks remote participants and their attributes
  - Can enable or disable the messaging subsystem
- **`MessageStreamChunk`** – Represents a single chunk in a stream, containing a header and optional binary data.
- **`MessageStreamWriter`** – A writer for sending streaming data (chunks) to a remote participant.
- **`MessageStreamReader`** – A reader that receives streaming data (chunks) from a remote participant.

## Example Usage

Below are some examples demonstrating how to use `MessagingClient` for basic messaging and streaming use cases.

### Basic Example: Sending and Receiving Messages


<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Suppose you already have a RoomClient instance named `room`

# Enable messaging (allows receiving participant and stream events)
await room.messaging.enable()

# Acquire a participant instance from somewhere; you might discover it via events
my_participant = ... # type: RemoteParticipant

# Send a simple message
await room.messaging.send_message({
  "to": my_participant,
  "type": "chat",
  "message": {"text": "Hello from Python!"}
})

# Broadcast a message to all participants
await room.messaging.broadcast_message({
  "type": "announcement",
  "message": {"content": "Hello everyone!"}
})

# Disable messaging
await room.messaging.disable()
```
```js JavaScript
// Suppose you already have a RoomClient instance named `room`

// Enable messaging
await room.messaging.enable();

// Acquire a participant instance from somewhere
const myParticipant = /* ...some RemoteParticipant... */;

// Send a simple message
await room.messaging.sendMessage({
  to: myParticipant,
  type: "chat",
  message: { text: "Hello from JavaScript!" },
});

// Broadcast a message
await room.messaging.broadcastMessage({
  type: "announcement",
  message: { content: "Hello everyone!" },
});

// Disable messaging
await room.messaging.disable();
```
```ts TypeScript
// Suppose you already have a RoomClient instance named `room`

// Enable messaging
await room.messaging.enable();

// Acquire a participant instance from somewhere
const myParticipant: RemoteParticipant = /* ...some RemoteParticipant... */;

// Send a simple message
await room.messaging.sendMessage({
  to: myParticipant,
  type: "chat",
  message: { text: "Hello from TypeScript!" },
});

// Broadcast a message
await room.messaging.broadcastMessage({
  type: "announcement",
  message: { content: "Hello everyone!" },
});

// Disable messaging
await room.messaging.disable();
```
```dart Dart
// Suppose you already have a RoomClient instance named `room`

// Enable messaging
await room.messaging.enable();

// Acquire a participant instance from somewhere
final myParticipant = /* ...some RemoteParticipant... */;

// Send a simple message
await room.messaging.sendMessage(
  to: myParticipant,
  type: "chat",
  message: {"text": "Hello from Dart!"},
);

// Broadcast a message
await room.messaging.broadcastMessage(
  type: "announcement",
  message: {"content": "Hello everyone!"},
);

// Disable messaging
await room.messaging.disable();
```

### Example: Creating and Handling Streams

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Create a new stream
stream_writer = await room.messaging.create_stream(
    to=my_participant,
    header={"streamPurpose": "file-transfer"}
)

# Write chunks
await stream_writer.write(MessageStreamChunk(
    header={"chunkNumber": 1},
    data=b"some binary data"
))

# Close the stream
await stream_writer.close()
```
```js JavaScript
// Create a new stream
const streamWriter = await room.messaging.createStream({
  to: myParticipant,
  header: { streamPurpose: "file-transfer" },
});

// Write chunks
await streamWriter.write(
  new MessageStreamChunk({
    header: { chunkNumber: 1 },
    data: new Uint8Array([/* binary data */]),
  })
);

// Close the stream
await streamWriter.close();
```
```ts TypeScript
// Create a new stream
const streamWriter = await room.messaging.createStream({
  to: myParticipant,
  header: { streamPurpose: "file-transfer" },
});

// Write chunks
await streamWriter.write(
  new MessageStreamChunk({
    header: { chunkNumber: 1 },
    data: new Uint8Array([/* binary data */]),
  })
);

// Close the stream
await streamWriter.close();
```
```dart Dart
// Create a new stream
final streamWriter = await room.messaging.createStream(
  to: myParticipant,
  header: {"streamPurpose": "file-transfer"},
);

// Write chunks
await streamWriter.write(MessageStreamChunk(
  header: {"chunkNumber": 1},
  data: Uint8List.fromList([/* some binary data */]),
));

// Close the stream
await streamWriter.close();
```

</CodeGroup>

---


### MessageStreamChunk

Represents a chunk of data in a stream, consisting of a header and optional binary data.

---


### MessageStreamWriter

A writer for sending streaming data to a remote participant, created via `MessagingClient.createStream()`.

- **`write(MessageStreamChunk)`**  
  Sends a chunk of data in the ongoing stream.
  
- **`close(): Promise<void>`**  
  Closes the stream, signaling to the remote participant that no more chunks will be sent.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Example usage after acquiring a MessageStreamWriter
await stream_writer.write(MessageStreamChunk(
  header={"part": 1},
  data=b"some binary data"
))
await stream_writer.close()
```
```js JavaScript
// Example usage after acquiring a MessageStreamWriter
await streamWriter.write(new MessageStreamChunk({
  header: { part: 1 },
  data: new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3])
}));
await streamWriter.close();
```
```ts TypeScript
// Example usage after acquiring a MessageStreamWriter
await streamWriter.write(new MessageStreamChunk({
  header: { part: 1 },
  data: new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3])
}));
await streamWriter.close();
```
```dart Dart
// Example usage after acquiring a MessageStreamWriter
await streamWriter.write(MessageStreamChunk(
  header: {"part": 1},
  data: Uint8List.fromList([1, 2, 3])
));
await streamWriter.close();
```
</CodeGroup>

1. **Event Emission**  
   `MessagingClient` extends `EventEmitter<RoomMessageEvent>`. It emits events whenever messages are received or streams are opened/closed. You can listen for the `"message"` event or for custom events like `"participant_added"`, `"participant_removed"`, etc.:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
room.messaging.on(
    "message",
    lambda evt: print("Received a message of type:", evt.message.type))

room.messaging.on(
    "participant_added",
    lambda evt: print("A new participant joined:", evt.message.message))
```
```js JavaScript
room.messaging.on("message", ({ message }) => {
   console.log("Received a message of type:", message.type);
});

room.messaging.on("participant_added", (evt) => {
   console.log("A new participant joined:", evt.message.message);
});
```
```ts TypeScript
room.messaging.on("message", ({ message }) => {
   console.log("Received a message of type:", message.type);
});

messagingClient.on("participant_added", (evt) => {
   console.log("A new participant joined:", evt.message.message);
});
```
```dart Dart
room.messaging.on("message", (evt) {
   print("Received a message of type: ${evt.message.type}");
});

room.messaging.on("participant_added", (evt) {
   print("A new participant joined: ${evt.message.message}");
});
```
</CodeGroup>


2. **Remote Participants**  
   `MessagingClient` automatically keeps track of participants joining or leaving when the messaging subsystem is enabled. You can access them via `remoteParticipants`.

3. **Error Handling**  
   - If a request fails or the server returns an error, the underlying `RoomClient` may throw an exception.
   - Stream operations (`createStream`, `write`, etc.) may also fail if the remote participant rejects or if the connection is lost.

4. **Extensibility**  
   You can add additional features—like chunk-level encryption, compression, or custom handshake logic—by extending `MessagingClient` or by wrapping the provided stream objects (`MessageStreamWriter` / `MessageStreamReader`).

5. **Performance**  
   For large or frequent streams, consider buffering or batching chunk writes in your client logic. The streaming mechanism in `MessagingClient` is designed to handle incremental data transfer, but network considerations remain important for efficient performance.
