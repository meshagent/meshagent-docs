title: Triple Whale
---


You can quickly test the Triplewhale MCP server and tools in a dedicated Meshagent Room using the steps below:

### Environment Variables

You’ll need to provide the following environment variable:
- **TRIPLEWHALE_API_KEY**: your-triplewhale-api-key-here

### Steps

1. **Install Meshagent CLI**
   ```sh
   pip install "meshagent[all]"
   ```
2. **Sign up and Authenticate**
   - Follow the [Meshagent Getting Started Guide](https://docs.meshagent.com/cli/getting_started) to create an account and log in via CLI.

3. **Start MCP Server in a Test Room**
   ```sh
   meshagent service test --room=test --role=agent --image=meshagent/mcp-triplewhale:latest \
     --env MESHAGENT_PORT=8001 --env TRIPLEWHALE_API_KEY=your-triplewhale-api-key-here \
     --port="num=8001 path=/webhook liveness=/ type=meshagent.callable" \
     --name=mcp-triplewhale-service-test
   ```
   - *This starts a Meshagent Room named `test` and runs the Triplewhale MCP server tool in it.*
   - *Room and services automatically close when inactive.*

4. **Start Chatbot Agent in the Room**
   ```sh
   meshagent chatbot join --room=test --agent-name=mcp-triplewhale \
     --name=mcp-triplewhale --toolkit=mcp-triplewhale
   ```
   - *This launches a chatbot in the same room, empowered with the Triplewhale toolkit. Multiple toolkits can be active simultaneously in a room.*
   - *A room link will appear in the CLI output.*

5. **Test in Your Browser**
   - Open the room URL in your browser to interact with the agent and MCP tools by sending messages.

## Project Level Deployment

For production setups, you may wish to create persistent MCP tools and chatbot agents at the project level. These services will *automatically join every new room created in your Meshagent project*, with no need for manual startup.

### Steps

1. **Deploy the MCP Server Agent (persistent)**
   ```sh
   meshagent service create --role=agent --image=meshagent/mcp-triplewhale:latest \
     --env MESHAGENT_PORT=8001 --env TRIPLEWHALE_API_KEY=your-triplewhale-api-key-here \
     --port="num=8001 path=/webhook liveness=/ type=meshagent.callable" \
     --name=mcp-triplewhale-service
   ```
2. **Deploy the Chatbot Agent (persistent)**
   ```sh
   meshagent service create --image="meshagent/cli:latest" \
     --port="num=9001 path=/agent liveness=/ type=meshagent.callable participant_name=mcp-triplewhale-chatbot" \
     --env="MESHAGENT_PORT=9001" --name="mcp-triplewhale-chatbot-service" \
     --command="meshagent chatbot service --agent-name=mcp-triplewhale-chatbot --toolkit=mcp-triplewhale"
   ```
   - *Both the MCP server tools and the chatbot will show up on *every* room creation inside your Meshagent project.*
   - *No need to run the MCP server or chatbot locally!*

## Tools Available

### Tools Summary

| Tool      | Short Description                                     |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `moby`    | moby tool helps users access e-commerce performance data.|

---

### Tools Details

#### Tool: **`moby`**
- The `moby` tool is designed to help users access e-commerce performance data from Triplewhale.
- To use the tool, the user must provide their **shopId** (an identifier for their e-commerce store).
- The user can ask questions related to their store’s performance, such as “What is my ROAS for Facebook campaigns in the last 60 days?”

**API Interaction:**
- The tool will send a request to the Triple Whale Moby API including the question, your shopId, and your API key.
- The response will include an array of answers, provided in a structured format, along with an assistant-generated summary.
- If data visualization or similar reports are available, links or format suggestions are included in the response.
- If errors occur (invalid key, unauthorized, missing shopId, etc.), clear error messages are provided:
  - Invalid credentials: "Invalid credentials. Please check your settings."
  - Missing shopId: The user is prompted to enter it.
  - API key expired or no shop access: "API key is expired or doesn't have access to the shop."
  - Generic errors: "Something went wrong. Please try again later."

**Response Structure:**

```ts
export type SimplifiedResponse = {
  isError: boolean;
  errorMsg?: string;
  question: string;
  answer: Record<string, string | number | null>[];
  assistant: string;
};

export type SimplifiedMobyResponse = {
  isError: boolean;
  error?: string;
  responses: SimplifiedResponse[];
  assistantConclusion: string;
};
```

Each valid response displays:
- The question asked.
- Answers in a structured, clear format.
- Data visualization suggestions (if any).
- Related report links (if provided).
- The assistant’s concluding summary, with follow-up prompts for further assistance.
