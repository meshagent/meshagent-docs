title: "Indexer"
---

An indexer adds content to a MeshAgent room's built in vector database to enable RAG scenarios. 

A few sample indexers are provided out of the box:

**StorageIndexer** - Listens to storage events and uses MarkitDown to automatically index files into the room's storage.

**SiteIndexer** - Exposes a TaskRunner that uses FireCrawl to index a website and add it to the room's index. To add a site to the index, invoke
    the SiteIndexer from the "Run Task..." menu or use the ```room.agents.ask``` API.

By providing a **RagToolkit** to a **Chatbot** or **VoiceBot**, your agent will gain the ability to perform RAG searches against the room's
built in vector store.
