          # Brand Review

          > If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

          Review marketing content against brand voice, style guidelines, and messaging standards. Flag deviations and provide specific improvement suggestions.

          ## Trigger

          User runs `/brand-review` or asks to review, check, or audit content against brand guidelines.

          ## Inputs

          1. **Content to review** — accept content in any of these forms:
            - Pasted directly into the conversation
            - A file path or ~~knowledge base reference (e.g. Notion page, shared doc)
            - A URL to a published page
            - Multiple pieces for batch review

          2. **Brand guidelines source** (determined automatically):
            - If a brand style guide is configured in local settings, use it automatically
            - If not configured, ask: "Do you have a brand style guide or voice guidelines I should review against? You can paste them, share a file, or describe your brand voice. Otherwise, I'll do a general review for clarity, consistency, and professionalism."

          ## Review Process

          ### With Brand Guidelines Configured

          Evaluate the content against each of these dimensions:

          #### Voice and Tone
          - Does the content match the defined brand voice attributes?
          - Is the tone appropriate for the content type and audience?
          - Are there shifts in voice that feel inconsistent?
          - Flag specific sentences or phrases that deviate with an explanation of why

          #### Terminology and Language
          - Are preferred brand terms used correctly?
          - Are any "avoid" terms or phrases present?
          - Is jargon level appropriate for the target audience?
          - Are product names, feature names, and branded terms used correctly (capitalization, formatting)?

          #### Messaging Pillars
          - Does the content align with defined messaging pillars or value propositions?
          - Are claims consistent with approved messaging?
          - Is the content reinforcing or contradicting brand positioning?

          #### Style Guide Compliance
          - Grammar and punctuation per style guide (e.g., Oxford comma, title case vs. sentence case)
          - Formatting conventions (headers, lists, emphasis)
          - Number formatting, date formatting
          - Acronym usage (defined on first use?)

          ### Without Brand Guidelines (Generic Review)

          Evaluate the content for:

          #### Clarity
          - Is the main message clear within the first paragraph?
          - Are sentences concise and easy to understand?
          - Is the structure logical and easy to follow?
          - Are there ambiguous statements or unclear references?

          #### Consistency
          - Is the tone consistent throughout?
          - Are terms used consistently (no switching between synonyms for the same concept)?
          - Is formatting consistent (headers, lists, capitalization)?

          #### Professionalism
          - Is the content free of typos, grammatical errors, and awkward phrasing?
          - Is the tone appropriate for the intended audience?
          - Are claims supported or substantiated?

          ### Legal and Compliance Flags (Always Checked)

          Regardless of whether brand guidelines are configured, flag:
          - **Unsubstantiated claims** — superlatives ("best", "fastest", "only") without evidence or qualification
          - **Missing disclaimers** — financial claims, health claims, or guarantees that may need legal disclaimers
          - **Comparative claims** — comparisons to competitors that could be challenged
          - **Regulatory language** — content that may need compliance review (financial services, healthcare, etc.)
          - **Testimonial issues** — quotes or endorsements without attribution or disclosure
          - **Copyright concerns** — content that appears to be closely paraphrased from other sources

          ## Output Format

          Present the review as:

          ### Summary
          - Overall assessment: how well the content aligns with brand standards (or general quality)
          - 1-2 sentence summary of the biggest strengths
          - 1-2 sentence summary of the most important improvements

          ### Detailed Findings

          For each issue found, provide:

          | Issue | Location | Severity | Suggestion |
          |-------|----------|----------|------------|

          Where severity is:
          - **High** — contradicts brand voice, contains compliance risk, or significantly undermines messaging
          - **Medium** — inconsistent with guidelines but not damaging
          - **Low** — minor style or preference issue

          ### Revised Sections

          For the top 3-5 highest-severity issues, provide a before/after showing the original text and a suggested revision.

          ### Legal/Compliance Flags

          List any legal or compliance concerns separately with recommended actions.

          ## After Review

          Ask: "Would you like me to:
          - Revise the full content with these suggestions applied?
          - Focus on fixing just the high-severity issues?
          - Review additional content against the same guidelines?
          - Help you document your brand voice for future reviews?"

        # Email Sequence

        > If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

        Design and draft complete email sequences with full copy, timing, branching logic, and performance benchmarks for any lifecycle or campaign use case.

        ## Trigger

        User runs `/email-sequence` or asks to create, design, build, or draft an email sequence, drip campaign, nurture flow, or onboarding series.

        ## Inputs

        Gather the following from the user. If not provided, ask before proceeding:

        1. **Sequence type** — one of:
          - Onboarding
          - Lead nurture
          - Re-engagement
          - Product launch
          - Event follow-up
          - Upgrade/upsell
          - Win-back
          - Educational drip

        2. **Goal** — what the sequence should achieve (e.g., activate new users, convert leads to customers, reduce churn, drive event attendance, upsell to a higher tier)

        3. **Audience** — who receives this sequence, what stage they are at, and any relevant segmentation details (role, industry, behavior triggers, lifecycle stage)

        4. **Number of emails** (optional) — if not specified, recommend a count based on the sequence type using the templates in the Sequence Type Templates section below

        5. **Timing/cadence preferences** (optional) — desired spacing between emails (e.g., "every 3 days", "weekly", "aggressive first week then taper off")

        6. **Brand voice** — if configured in local settings, apply automatically and inform the user. If not configured, ask: "Do you have brand voice guidelines I should follow? If not, I'll use a clear, conversational professional tone."

        7. **Additional context** (optional):
          - Specific offers, discounts, or incentives to include
          - CTAs or landing pages to link to
          - Content assets available (blog posts, case studies, videos, guides)
          - Product features to highlight
          - Competitor differentiators to reference

        ## Process

        ### 1. Sequence Strategy

        Before drafting any emails, define the overall sequence architecture:

        - **Narrative arc** — what story does this sequence tell across all emails? What is the emotional and logical progression from first email to last?
        - **Journey mapping** — map each email to a stage of the buyer or user journey (awareness, consideration, decision, activation, expansion)
        - **Escalation logic** — how does the intensity, urgency, or value of each email build on the previous one?
        - **Success definition** — what specific action signals that the sequence has done its job and the recipient should exit?

        ### 2. Individual Email Design

        For each email in the sequence, produce:

        #### Subject Line
        - Provide 2-3 options per email
        - Vary approaches: curiosity, benefit-driven, urgency, personalization, question-based
        - Keep under 50 characters where possible; note preview behavior on mobile

        #### Preview Text
        - 40-90 characters that complement (not repeat) the subject line
        - Should add context or intrigue that increases open likelihood

        #### Email Purpose
        - One sentence explaining why this email exists and what it moves the recipient toward

        #### Body Copy
        - Full draft ready to use
        - Clear hierarchy: hook, body, CTA
        - Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
        - Scannable formatting with bold key phrases where appropriate
        - Personalization tokens where relevant (e.g., first name, company name, product used)

        #### Primary CTA
        - Button text and destination
        - One primary CTA per email (secondary CTA only if appropriate for the sequence stage)

        #### Timing
        - Days after the trigger event or after the previous email
        - Note if timing should adjust based on engagement (e.g., "send sooner if they opened but did not click")

        #### Segment/Condition Notes
        - Who receives this email vs. who skips it
        - Any behavioral or attribute-based conditions (e.g., "only send to users who have not completed setup")

        ### 3. Sequence Logic

        Define the flow control for the sequence:

        - **Branching conditions** — alternate paths based on engagement. For example:
          - "If opened email 2 but did not click CTA, send email 2b (softer re-ask) instead of email 3"
          - "If clicked CTA in email 1, skip email 2 and go directly to email 3"
        - **Exit conditions** — when a recipient converts (completes the desired action), remove them from the sequence. Define what "conversion" means for this sequence.
        - **Re-entry rules** — can someone re-enter the sequence? Under what conditions? (e.g., "if a user churns again 90 days later, re-enter the win-back sequence")
        - **Suppression rules** — do not send if the recipient is already in another active sequence, has unsubscribed from marketing, or has contacted support in the last 48 hours

        ### 4. Performance Benchmarks

        Provide expected benchmarks based on the sequence type so the user can set targets:

        | Metric | Onboarding | Lead Nurture | Re-engagement | Win-back |
        |--------|-----------|--------------|---------------|----------|
        | Open rate | 50-70% | 20-30% | 15-25% | 15-20% |
        | Click-through rate | 10-20% | 3-7% | 2-5% | 2-4% |
        | Conversion rate | 15-30% | 2-5% | 3-8% | 1-3% |
        | Unsubscribe rate | <0.5% | <0.5% | 1-2% | 1-3% |

        Adjust benchmarks based on industry and audience if the user has provided that context.

        ## Sequence Type Templates

        Use these as starting frameworks. Adapt length and content based on the user's goal and audience.

        **Onboarding (5-7 emails over 14-21 days):**
        Welcome and set expectations -- Quick win to demonstrate value -- Core feature deep dive -- Advanced feature or integration -- Social proof and community -- Check-in and feedback request -- Upgrade prompt or next steps

        **Lead Nurture (4-6 emails over 3-4 weeks):**
        Value-first educational content -- Pain point identification -- Solution positioning with proof -- Social proof and results -- Soft CTA (trial, demo, resource) -- Direct CTA (buy, book, sign up)

        **Re-engagement (3-4 emails over 10-14 days):**
        "We miss you" with a compelling reason to return -- Value reminder highlighting what they are missing -- Incentive or exclusive offer -- Last chance with clear deadline

        **Win-back (3-5 emails over 30 days):**
        Friendly check-in asking what went wrong -- What is new since they left -- Special offer or incentive to return -- Feedback request (even if they do not come back) -- Final goodbye with door open

        **Product Launch (4-6 emails over 2-3 weeks):**
        Teaser or pre-announcement -- Launch announcement with full details -- Feature spotlight or use case -- Social proof and early results -- Limited-time offer or bonus -- Last chance or reminder

        **Event Follow-up (3-4 emails over 7-10 days):**
        Thank you with key takeaways or recordings -- Resource roundup from the event -- Related offer or next step -- Feedback survey

        **Upgrade/Upsell (3-5 emails over 2-3 weeks):**
        Usage milestone or success celebration -- Feature gap or limitation they are hitting -- Upgrade benefits with proof -- Limited-time incentive -- Direct comparison of plans

        **Educational Drip (5-8 emails over 4-6 weeks):**
        Introduction and what they will learn -- Lesson 1: foundational concept -- Lesson 2: intermediate concept -- Lesson 3: advanced concept -- Practical application or exercise -- Resource roundup -- Graduation and next steps

        ## Tool Integration

        ### If ~~email marketing is connected (e.g., Klaviyo, Mailchimp, Customer.io)
        - Reference how to set up the sequence as a flow or automation in the platform
        - Note any platform-specific features to use (e.g., smart send time, conditional splits, A/B testing)
        - Map the branching logic to the platform's visual flow builder concepts

        ### If ~~marketing automation or ~~CRM is connected (e.g., HubSpot, Marketo)
        - Reference lead scoring data to inform segmentation and exit conditions
        - Use lifecycle stage data to tailor messaging per segment
        - Note how to set enrollment triggers based on CRM properties or list membership

        ### If no tools are connected
        - Deliver all email content in copy-paste-ready format
        - Include a setup checklist the user can follow in any email platform:
          1. Create the automation or flow
          2. Set the enrollment trigger
          3. Add each email with the specified delays
          4. Configure branching and exit conditions
          5. Set up tracking for the recommended metrics

        ## Output

        Present the complete sequence with the following sections:

        ### A/B Test Suggestions
        - 2-3 recommended A/B tests (subject lines, CTA text, send time, email length)
        - What to test, how to split, and how to measure the winner

        ### Metrics to Track
        - Primary conversion metric for the sequence
        - Per-email metrics: open rate, CTR, unsubscribe rate
        - Sequence-level metrics: overall conversion rate, time to conversion, drop-off points
        - Recommended review cadence (e.g., "Review performance weekly for the first month, then monthly")

        ## After the Sequence

        Ask: "Would you like me to:
        - Revise the copy or tone for any specific email?
        - Add a branching path for a specific scenario?
        - Create a variation of this sequence for a different audience segment?
        - Draft the A/B test variants for the subject lines?
        - Build a companion sequence (e.g., a post-purchase follow-up after this lead nurture converts)?"

        ---

        # /seo-audit

        > If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

        Audit a website's SEO health, research keyword opportunities, identify content gaps, and benchmark against competitors. Produces a prioritized action plan a marketer can execute immediately.

        ## Trigger

        User runs `/seo-audit` or asks for an SEO audit, keyword research, content gap analysis, technical SEO check, or competitor SEO comparison.

        ## Inputs

        Gather the following from the user. If not provided, ask before proceeding:

        1. **URL or domain** — the site to audit, or a topic/keyword if running in keyword research mode

        2. **Audit type** — one of:
          - **Full site audit** — end-to-end SEO review covering all sections below
          - **Keyword research** — identify keyword opportunities for a topic or domain
          - **Content gap analysis** — find topics competitors rank for that you don't
          - **Technical SEO check** — crawlability, speed, structured data, and infrastructure issues
          - **Competitor SEO comparison** — head-to-head SEO benchmarking against specific competitors

          If not specified, default to **full site audit**.

        3. **Target keywords or topics** (optional) — specific keywords the user is already targeting or wants to rank for

        4. **Competitors** (optional) — domains or companies to compare against. If not provided and the audit type requires competitor data, use web search to identify 2-3 likely competitors based on the user's domain and keyword space.

        ## Process

        ### 1. Keyword Research

        Research keywords related to the user's domain, topic, or target keywords.

        **If ~~SEO tools are connected:**
        - Pull keyword data, search volume, keyword difficulty scores, and ranking positions automatically
        - Identify keywords the site currently ranks for and where it's gaining or losing ground

        **If ~~product analytics are connected:**
        - Cross-reference keyword targets with actual organic traffic data to validate which keywords are driving visits and conversions

        **If tools are not connected:**
        - Use web search to research the keyword landscape
        - Note: "For more precise volume and difficulty data, connect an SEO tool like Ahrefs or Semrush via MCP. The audit will auto-populate with ranking data."

        For each keyword opportunity, assess:
        - **Primary keywords** — high-intent terms directly tied to the user's product or service
        - **Secondary keywords** — supporting terms and variations
        - **Search volume signals** — relative demand (high, medium, low) based on available data
        - **Keyword difficulty** — how competitive the term is (easy, moderate, hard)
        - **Long-tail opportunities** — specific, lower-competition phrases with clear intent
        - **Question-based keywords** — "how to", "what is", "why does" queries that mirror People Also Ask results
        - **Intent classification** — informational, navigational, commercial, or transactional

        ### 2. On-Page SEO Audit

        For each key page (homepage, top landing pages, recent blog posts), evaluate:

        - **Title tags** — present, unique, within 50-60 characters, includes target keyword
        - **Meta descriptions** — present, compelling, within 150-160 characters, includes a call to action
        - **H1 tags** — exactly one per page, includes primary keyword
        - **H2/H3 structure** — logical hierarchy, uses secondary keywords where natural
        - **Keyword usage** — primary keyword appears in the first 100 words, used naturally throughout, not over-stuffed
        - **Internal linking** — pages link to related content, orphan pages identified, anchor text is descriptive
        - **Image alt text** — all images have descriptive alt attributes, keywords included where relevant
        - **URL structure** — clean, readable, includes keywords, no excessive parameters or depth

        ### 3. Content Gap Analysis

        Identify what's missing from the user's content strategy:

        - **Competitor topic coverage** — topics and keywords competitors rank for that the user's site does not cover
        - **Content freshness** — pages that haven't been updated in 12+ months and may be losing rankings
        - **Thin content** — pages with insufficient depth to rank (under 300 words for informational queries, lacking substance)
        - **Missing content types** — formats competitors use that the user doesn't (guides, comparison pages, glossaries, tools, templates)
        - **Funnel gaps** — missing content at specific buyer journey stages (awareness, consideration, decision)
        - **Topic clusters** — opportunities to build pillar pages with supporting content

        ### 4. Technical SEO Checklist

        Evaluate technical foundations that affect crawlability and rankings:

        - **Page speed** — identify slow-loading pages and likely causes (large images, render-blocking scripts, excessive redirects)
        - **Mobile-friendliness** — responsive design, tap targets, font sizes, viewport configuration
        - **Structured data** — opportunities for schema markup (FAQ, HowTo, Product, Article, Organization, Breadcrumb)
        - **Crawlability** — robots.txt configuration, XML sitemap presence and accuracy, canonical tags, noindex/nofollow usage
        - **Broken links** — internal and external 404s, redirect chains
        - **HTTPS** — secure connection, mixed content issues
        - **Core Web Vitals signals** — LCP, FID/INP, CLS indicators based on observable page behavior
        - **Indexation** — pages that should be indexed but may not be, duplicate content risks

        ### 5. Competitor SEO Comparison

        For each competitor, compare:

        - **Keyword overlap** — keywords both sites rank for, and where each site ranks higher
        - **Keyword gaps** — terms the competitor ranks for that the user does not
        - **Domain authority signals** — relative site strength based on backlink profiles, referring domains, and content depth
        - **Content depth** — average content length, topic coverage breadth, publishing frequency
        - **Backlink profile observations** — types of sites linking to competitors, link-worthy content they've produced
        - **SERP feature ownership** — which competitor appears in featured snippets, People Also Ask, image packs, or knowledge panels
        - **Technical advantages** — site speed differences, mobile experience, structured data usage

        # Brand Voice Skill

        Frameworks for documenting, applying, and enforcing brand voice and style guidelines across marketing content.

        ## Brand Voice Documentation Framework

        A complete brand voice document should cover these areas. Use this framework to help users define their brand voice or to understand an existing brand voice configuration.

        ### 1. Brand Personality
        Define the brand as if it were a person. What are its defining traits?

        Example: "If our brand were a person, they would be a knowledgeable colleague who explains complex things simply, celebrates your wins genuinely, and never talks down to you."

        ### 2. Voice Attributes
        Select 3-5 attributes that define how the brand communicates. Each attribute should be defined with:
        - What it means in practice
        - What it does NOT mean (to prevent misinterpretation)
        - An example demonstrating the attribute

        ### 3. Audience Awareness
        - Who the brand is speaking to (primary and secondary audiences)
        - What the audience cares about
        - What level of expertise the audience has
        - How the audience expects to be addressed

        ### 4. Core Messaging Pillars
        - 3-5 key themes the brand consistently communicates
        - The hierarchy of these messages (which comes first)
        - How each pillar connects to audience needs

        ### 5. Tone Spectrum
        How the voice adapts across contexts while remaining recognizably the same brand.

        ### 6. Style Rules
        Specific grammar, formatting, and language rules. See the Style Guide Enforcement section below.

        ### 7. Terminology
        Preferred and avoided terms. See the Terminology Management section below.

        ## Voice Attributes

        ### Common Voice Attribute Pairs

        When defining brand voice, it helps to position attributes on a spectrum. Here are common attribute spectrums:

        | Spectrum | One End | Other End |
        |----------|---------|-----------|
        | Formality | Formal, institutional | Casual, conversational |
        | Authority | Expert, authoritative | Peer-level, collaborative |
        | Emotion | Warm, empathetic | Direct, matter-of-fact |
        | Complexity | Technical, precise | Simple, accessible |
        | Energy | Bold, energetic | Calm, measured |
        | Humor | Playful, witty | Serious, earnest |
        | Innovation | Cutting-edge, forward-looking | Established, proven |

        ### Defining an Attribute

        For each chosen attribute, document it in this format:

        **[Attribute name]**
        - **We are**: [what this means in practice]
        - **We are not**: [common misinterpretation to avoid]
        - **This sounds like**: [example sentence demonstrating the attribute]
        - **This does NOT sound like**: [example sentence violating the attribute]

        Example:

        **Approachable**
        - **We are**: friendly, clear, jargon-free, welcoming to beginners and experts alike
        - **We are not**: dumbed-down, overly casual, or lacking substance
        - **This sounds like**: "Here's how to get started — it takes about five minutes."
        - **This does NOT sound like**: "Yo! This is super easy, even a noob can do it lol."

        ## Tone Adaptation Across Channels and Contexts

        The brand voice stays consistent, but tone adapts to context. Tone is the emotional inflection applied to the voice.

        ### Tone by Channel

        | Channel | Tone Adaptation | Example |
        |---------|----------------|---------|
        | Blog | Informative, conversational, educational | "Let's walk through how this works and why it matters for your team." |
        | Social media (LinkedIn) | Professional, thought-provoking, concise | "Three things we learned from running 50 campaigns this quarter." |
        | Social media (Twitter/X) | Punchy, direct, sometimes witty | "Your landing page has 3 seconds. Make them count." |
        | Email marketing | Personal, helpful, action-oriented | "We put together something we think you'll find useful." |
        | Sales collateral | Confident, benefit-driven, specific | "Teams using our platform reduce reporting time by 40%." |
        | Support/Help docs | Clear, patient, step-by-step | "If you see this error, here's how to fix it." |
        | Press release | Formal, factual, newsworthy | "The company today announced the launch of..." |
        | Error messages | Empathetic, helpful, blame-free | "Something went wrong on our end. We're looking into it." |

        ### Tone by Situation

        | Situation | Tone Adaptation |
        |-----------|----------------|
        | Product launch | Excited, confident, forward-looking |
        | Incident or outage | Transparent, empathetic, accountable |
        | Customer success story | Celebratory, specific, crediting the customer |
        | Thought leadership | Authoritative, nuanced, evidence-based |
        | Onboarding | Welcoming, encouraging, clear |
        | Bad news (price increase, deprecation) | Honest, respectful, solution-oriented |
        | Competitive comparison | Confident but fair, fact-based, not disparaging |

        ### Tone Adaptation Rule
        The voice attributes remain fixed. Tone dials them up or down based on context. For example, if a brand is "bold and warm":
        - In a product launch, dial up boldness
        - In an incident response, dial up warmth
        - Neither attribute disappears; the balance shifts

        ## Style Guide Enforcement

        ### Grammar and Mechanics
        Document and enforce these choices consistently:

        | Rule | Options | Example |
        |------|---------|---------|
        | Oxford comma | Yes / No | "fast, reliable, and secure" vs. "fast, reliable and secure" |
        | Sentence case vs. title case (headings) | Sentence / Title | "How to get started" vs. "How to Get Started" |
        | Contractions | Use / Avoid | "we're" vs. "we are" |
        | Em dash spacing | No spaces / Spaces | "this—and more" vs. "this — and more" |
        | Numbers | Spell out 1-9, numerals 10+ / Always numerals | "five features" vs. "5 features" |
        | Percent | % / percent | "50%" vs. "50 percent" |
        | Date format | Month DD, YYYY / DD/MM/YYYY / etc. | "January 15, 2025" |
        | Time format | 12-hour / 24-hour | "3:00 PM" vs. "15:00" |
        | Lists | Periods / No periods on fragments | "Set up your account." vs. "Set up your account" |

        ### Formatting Conventions
        - Heading hierarchy (when to use H1, H2, H3)
        - Bold and italic usage (bold for emphasis, italic for titles/terms)
        - Link text (descriptive vs. "click here" — always descriptive)
        - Image alt text requirements
        - Code formatting (for technical brands)
        - Callout or highlight box usage

        ### Punctuation and Emphasis
        - Exclamation mark policy (limited use, never more than one)
        - Ellipsis usage (avoid in most professional contexts)
        - ALL CAPS policy (avoid; use bold for emphasis instead)
        - Emoji usage by channel (professional channels: minimal or none; social: where appropriate)

        ## Terminology Management

        ### Preferred Terms

        Maintain a list of preferred terms and their incorrect alternatives:

        | Use This | Not This | Notes |
        |----------|----------|-------|
        | sign up (verb) | signup (verb) | "signup" is the noun form |
        | log in (verb) | login (verb) | "login" is the noun/adjective form |
        | set up (verb) | setup (verb) | "setup" is the noun/adjective form |
        | email | e-mail | No hyphen |
        | website | web site | One word |
        | data is (singular) | data are | Unless the publication requires plural |

        ### Product and Feature Names
        - Official capitalization for product names
        - When to use the full product name vs. shorthand
        - Whether to use "the" before product names
        - How to handle versioning in copy
        - Trademark and registration symbols (when required and when to omit)

        ### Inclusive Language
        - Use gender-neutral language (they/them for unknown individuals)
        - Avoid ableist language ("crazy", "blind spot", "lame")
        - Use person-first language where appropriate
        - Avoid culturally specific idioms that may not translate
        - Use "simple" or "straightforward" instead of "easy" (what is easy varies by person)

        ### Industry Jargon Management
        - Define which technical terms the audience understands without explanation
        - List jargon that should always be defined or replaced with plain language
        - Specify which acronyms need to be spelled out on first use
        - Audience-specific glossary for terms that mean different things to different readers

        ### Competitor and Category Terms
        - How to refer to your product category (use your preferred framing)
        - How to refer to competitors (by name or generically)
        - Terms competitors have coined that you should avoid (to prevent reinforcing their positioning)
        - Your preferred differentiation language

          ---

          # Canned Responses Skill

          You are a response template assistant for an in-house legal team. You help manage, customize, and generate templated responses for common legal inquiries, and you identify when a situation should NOT use a templated response and instead requires individualized attention.

          **Important**: You assist with legal workflows but do not provide legal advice. Templated responses should be reviewed before sending, especially for regulated communications.

          ## Template Management Methodology

          ### Template Organization

          Templates should be organized by category and maintained in the team's local settings. Each template should include:

          1. **Category**: The type of inquiry the template addresses
          2. **Template name**: A descriptive identifier
          3. **Use case**: When this template is appropriate
          4. **Escalation triggers**: When this template should NOT be used
          5. **Required variables**: Information that must be customized for each use
          6. **Template body**: The response text with variable placeholders
          7. **Follow-up actions**: Standard steps after sending the response
          8. **Last reviewed date**: When the template was last verified for accuracy

          ### Template Lifecycle

          1. **Creation**: Draft template based on best practices and team input
          2. **Review**: Legal team review and approval of template content
          3. **Publication**: Add to template library with metadata
          4. **Use**: Generate responses using the template
          5. **Feedback**: Track when templates are modified during use to identify improvement opportunities
          6. **Update**: Revise templates when laws, policies, or best practices change
          7. **Retirement**: Archive templates that are no longer applicable

          ## Customization Guidelines

          When generating a response from a template:

          ### Required Customization
          Every templated response MUST be customized with:
          - Correct names, dates, and reference numbers
          - Specific facts of the situation
          - Applicable jurisdiction and regulation
          - Correct response deadlines based on when the inquiry was received
          - Appropriate signature block and contact information

          ### Tone Adjustment
          Adjust tone based on:
          - **Audience**: Internal vs. external, business vs. legal, individual vs. regulatory authority
          - **Relationship**: New counterparty vs. existing partner vs. adversarial party
          - **Sensitivity**: Routine inquiry vs. contentious matter vs. regulatory investigation
          - **Urgency**: Standard timeline vs. expedited response needed

          ### Jurisdiction-Specific Adjustments
          - Verify that cited regulations are correct for the requester's jurisdiction
          - Adjust timelines to match applicable law
          - Include jurisdiction-specific rights information
          - Use jurisdiction-appropriate legal terminology

          ## Escalation Trigger Identification

          Every template category has situations where a templated response is inappropriate. Before generating any response, check for these escalation triggers:

          ### Universal Escalation Triggers (Apply to All Categories)
          - The matter involves potential litigation or regulatory investigation
          - The inquiry is from a regulator, government agency, or law enforcement
          - The response could create a binding legal commitment or waiver
          - The matter involves potential criminal liability
          - Media attention is involved or likely
          - The situation is unprecedented (no prior handling by the team)
          - Multiple jurisdictions are involved with conflicting requirements
          - The matter involves executive leadership or board members

          ### Category-Specific Escalation Triggers

          **Data Subject Requests**:
          - Request from a minor or on behalf of a minor
          - Request involves data subject to litigation hold
          - Requester is in active litigation or dispute with the organization
          - Request is from an employee with an active HR matter
          - Request scope is so broad it appears to be a fishing expedition
          - Request involves special category data (health, biometric, genetic)

          **Discovery Holds**:
          - Potential criminal liability
          - Unclear or disputed preservation scope
          - Hold conflicts with regulatory deletion requirements
          - Prior holds exist for related matters
          - Custodian objects to the hold scope

          **Vendor Questions**:
          - Vendor is disputing contract terms
          - Vendor is threatening litigation or termination
          - Response could affect ongoing negotiation
          - Question involves regulatory compliance (not just contract interpretation)

          **Subpoena / Legal Process**:
          - ALWAYS requires counsel review (templates are starting points only)
          - Privilege issues identified
          - Third-party data involved
          - Cross-border production issues
          - Unreasonable timeline

          ### When an Escalation Trigger is Detected

          1. **Stop**: Do not generate a templated response
          2. **Alert**: Inform the user that an escalation trigger has been detected
          3. **Explain**: Describe which trigger was detected and why it matters
          4. **Recommend**: Suggest the appropriate escalation path (senior counsel, outside counsel, specific team member)
          5. **Offer**: Provide a draft for counsel review (clearly marked as "DRAFT - FOR COUNSEL REVIEW ONLY") rather than a final response

          ## Template Creation Guide

          When helping users create new templates:

          ### Step 1: Define the Use Case
          - What type of inquiry does this address?
          - How frequently does this come up?
          - Who is the typical audience?
          - What is the typical urgency level?

          ### Step 2: Identify Required Elements
          - What information must be included in every response?
          - What regulatory requirements apply?
          - What organizational policies govern this type of response?

          ### Step 3: Define Variables
          - What changes with each use? (names, dates, specifics)
          - What stays the same? (legal requirements, standard language)
          - Use clear variable names: `{{requester_name}}`, `{{response_deadline}}`, `{{matter_reference}}`

          ### Step 4: Draft the Template
          - Write in clear, professional language
          - Avoid unnecessary legal jargon for business audiences
          - Include all legally required elements
          - Add placeholders for all variable content
          - Include a subject line template if for email use

          ### Step 5: Define Escalation Triggers
          - What situations should NOT use this template?
          - What characteristics indicate the matter needs individualized attention?
          - Be specific: vague triggers are not useful

          ### Step 6: Add Metadata
          - Template name and category
          - Version number and last reviewed date
          - Author and approver
          - Follow-up actions checklist

          ### Template Format

          ```markdown
          ## Template: {{template_name}}
          **Category**: {{category}}
          **Version**: {{version}} | **Last Reviewed**: {{date}}
