title: "How Tools and Toolkits Work"
---

MeshAgent Tools aren’t just for agents — people can use them too. This guide explains how tools, toolkits, and rooms fit together so that both humans and AI agents can safely discover, call, and share capabilities. You’ll see how tools are defined, validated, executed, and connected to MeshAgent rooms. 

## Mental Model (how tool concepts fit together)
- ``Tool`` = one action your agent can take (e.g., WriteDocument, PresentForm).
- ``Toolkit`` = a named bundle of tools plus optional rules (“how to use these tools”).
- ``ToolContext`` = everything a tool needs at call time (the room handle, who called, optional “on behalf of”, extra caller context).
- ``RemoteToolkit`` = a runtime wrapper that registers your toolkit with the room, listens for tool calls, validates inputs, runs the tool, and returns a structured Response.

## `ToolContext`
MeshAgent tools are passed a ``ToolContext`` which contains a variety of information that may be of use to the tool:


| Property | Description |
|---|---|
|**room** | a room client that can be used to interact with the room or other participants in the room|
|**caller** | the participant who called the tool|
|**on_behalf_of** | if the tool was called by an agent that was acting on behalf of a user, the participant who invoked the agent|
|**caller_context** | an optional dictionary of caller specific context data, this can be used to provide custom context data to the tool. For instance, this can be used for allowing agent based tools to receive the current chat context for implementing patterns such as handoffs.|
