MeshAgent Agents are processes that accept input and produce output. In many cases, your agent will be powered by a LLM, but it could also just be code that performs a task. 

This walkthrough shows how to: 
- Create a ChatBot
- Call it into a room
- Interact with it from the MeshAgent Studio. 

## Step 1: Create an agent with ``ServiceHost`` 

Let's create a simple ``ChatBot`` that takes a system prompt (rules). 

To run the ``ChatBot`` we'll use the MeshAgent ``ServiceHost``. The ``ServiceHost`` is a lightweight HTTP server that allows you to register one or more tools or agents on their own path (e.g., ``/agent``). The host automatically exposes each path as a webhook. When a room “makes a call” to that path, ``ServiceHost`` handles the handshake, connects the agent to the room, and forwards requests and responses between your code and the MeshAgent infrastructure.

<CodeGroup>
    <Chatbot />
</CodeGroup>


## Step 2: Call the agent into a room

```bash 
meshagent setup # authenticate to MeshAgent
meshagent service run "main.py" --room=quickstart
```

This command will start the chatbot on an available port at the path ``/agent``. If you are running multiple agents or tools, you can use the same ``ServiceHost`` and set different paths for each of the agents. The ``service run`` command automatically detects the different agent paths and identities (this is the recommended way to test your agents and tools). 

As an alternative to the ``service run`` command you can also run the service locally by running ``python main.py`` in one tab in your terminal, then from another tab you can call individual agents into the room using the ``meshagent call agent`` command. For example: 

```bash bash
meshagent setup # authenticate to meshagent
meshagent call agent --url=http://localhost:8081/agent --room=quickstart --participant-name=chatbot
```

In either case, the agent joins the room as participant ``chatbot``. Once the agent joins the room, you can converse with it in [MeshAgent Studio](https://www.studio.meshagent.com).

## Step 3: Interact with the Agent in MeshAgent Studio
1. Go to [MeshAgent Studio](https://www.studio.meshagent.com) and login
2. Enter your room ``quickstart``
3. Select the agent ``chatbot`` and begin chatting!

## Step 4: Package and Deploy the Agent
Now that our agent is working we can package and deploy it so it's always available for us to use! To do so we'll need to create a `meshagent.yaml` file which defines how our agent should run. 

If you are building your own custom agent you'll also need to create a Dockerfile and build and push your container. Use `docker buildx` and push with `--platform linux/amd64`. 

For the sake of this example, we can use an existing MeshAgent base image which already has the code to run our agent!

**Package the agent**
Create a file called `meshagent.yaml`

<CodeGroup>
    <ChatbotYaml />
</CodeGroup>

**Deploy the agent**
Next from the CLI in the folder where your `meshagent.yaml` file is run: 

```bash
meshagent service create --file "meshagent.yaml" --room=quickstart
```

The `ChatBot` is now deployed to the `quickstart` room! Now the agent will always be available inside the room for us to chat with. 


## Next Steps
- Add custom rules or toolkits to your agent: 
  - See [Build a Chat Agent](./buildanddeploychatbot) to learn how to add built-in MeshAgent tools (for things like presenting a UI or writing to documents), and custom tools to your chatbot.
  - [TaskRunner](./taskrunner) to learn how to run agents from other agent frameworks, "agents" without an LLM, and more.
  - [Tools Quickstart](../tools/quickstart) to learn how to build custom tools. 
- Learn more about [services and containers](../../services_room_containers/overview) to deploy your agent as a MeshAgent project-wide service or run it in a specific room with the Containers API. 
- Explore the broader [Room Agents Client](../../room_api/agents) for more information on listing agents, discovering tools, invoking tools, and more.
