Meshagent Agents are just processes that accept input and produce output. In many cases, your agent will be powered by a LLM, but in other cases your agent might be doing things that are easier to write code for.

## Our First Agent

Let's create a simple agent that can add two numbers and connect it to our room:


<CodeGroup>
    <Example />
</CodeGroup>


<CodeGroup>
    <AgentsAdder />
</CodeGroup>


From the admin console, if we select "Run" we can now select this agent to test it. We haven't built any UI, but we don't need to!
By default, the admin console will launch it's own agent that will gather input from the user, send it to our sample agent, and show the results back to the user.

## Writing to documents

Often we want our agents to be able to interact with live documents. MeshAgent makes it very easy to build agents that can connect to an manipulate documents.
Let's create a simple agent that will write content to the document that the user requests.

+++ Python
:::code source="/examples/python/agents-writer.py":::
+++

After starting our agent, we can run it directly from the Admin console.

1. Open our room in the admin console
2. Create a document, let's call it "sample.document".
3. Click the "Run" button, select "sample_writer" and then "continue"
4. A built-in assistant agent will be launched which will gather information and forward it to our sample writer.

After the agent is invoked, we will see its output automatically show up in our document.

## Taking it Futher

Check out these built in agents in the [meshkit-agents]() for some ideas. Depending on your usecase, you may be able to use these agents out of the box without any customization. You may
also use them as a base for your own agents to get up and running faster:

- **SingleShotWriter** A basic writer that uses an LLM to generate document content.
- **PlanningWriter:** A more advanced writer that implements a simple planning strategy and allows the agent to edit and create documents using tool calls.
- **Transcriber** A transcription agent that can join a video conference and transcribe the audio of participants
- **ProofReader** An agent that listens for changes on a document and automatically improves the text
- **VoiceProofReader** An agent that listens for changes on a document and gives feedback via voice about suggestions in realtime
