title: Introduction to Containers
---

Containers enable **dynamic code execution** in MeshAgent rooms, allowing users to safely run their own code when they need it. They provide a **secure sandbox for executing custom functionality on-demand**.

## How Containers Work

Containers are user-initiated applications that run in specific rooms. Unlike services, containers are not automatically available when the room starts - they're deployed at runtime based on user needs.
