title: MeshAgent Studio
---

[MeshAgent Studio](https://studio.meshagent.com) is the browser-based control plane for MeshAgent. Use it to create projects, spin up rooms, invite teammates, deploy services, and monitor usage without leaving your browser. Studio mirrors the MeshAgent CLI, so anything you configure in one surface is immediately reflected in the other. 

## Project selector and account menu

MeshAgent Studio opens to an active project. Use the dropdown in the upper-left corner to switch between projects you belong to or create a new one. Select the menu option in the upper-right corner to logout. 

## Rooms

The Rooms view is the fastest path to collaborating with agents and teammates:

- Create or join rooms by name; Studio provisions the room automatically when you land in it.
- View active participants (humans, agents, services) plus their current scopes.
- Inspect real-time logs, traces, and tool calls from the Developer Console without attaching a debugger.
- Upload files, pin documents, and browse room storage so agents share the same context as humans.
- Start/stop CLI-hosted agents from the Participants panel or convert them into always-on services.

## Members

Members lists everyone with access to the current project. From here you can:

- Invite collaborators via email and assign roles/scopes as they join.
- Adjust permissions (e.g., limit who can deploy services or view billing data).
- Remove members who no longer need access to sensitive rooms or data.

## API Keys

API keys let headless environments (CI, deployed services, scripting) authenticate against MeshAgent:

- Generate project-scoped keys, optionally activating them immediately for CLI use.
- Label keys with the owning service or automation so you know what to rotate later.
- Revoke or rotate compromised keys and the change propagates instantly across the platform.

## Services

Services turn your agents, toolkits, or connectors into reusable building blocks:

- View all project services plus room-scoped services at a glance.
- Deploy new versions by pointing to a container image or CLI quickstart template.
- Monitor health, recent logs, and deployment history to diagnose failures quickly.

## Secrets

Secrets store encrypted credentials and configuration that services and tools can read at runtime:

- Create key/value pairs or JSON blobs; values never reappear after you leave the page.
- Scope secrets to specific rooms or keep them project-wide.
- Audit which services have requested each secret to simplify compliance reviews.

## Webhooks

Webhooks notify your systems when something interesting happens inside MeshAgent:

- Subscribe to events like room created/ended, participant joined, tool invoked, or service failure.
- Configure delivery URLs, shared secrets, and retry policies.
- View recent deliveries and replay payloads when downstream systems were unavailable.

## Integrations

Integrations connect MeshAgent to external providers (e.g., MCP servers, OpenAI Connectors, storage backends):

- Register providers once and reuse them across services and rooms.
- Configure per-provider credentials, rate limits, and fallback behaviors.
- Validate connections from Studio before handing the integration to an agent.

## OAuth

The OAuth tab manages first-party and custom OAuth clients:

- Create clients with redirect URIs for Studio, staging, and production.
- Define scopes and grant types to precisely control how agents or UIs authenticate.
- Rotate client secrets and download metadata for your app configuration files.

## Usage

Usage surfaces observability and cost at the project level:

- Track credits, minutes, and per-provider spend by day or billing cycle.
- Drill into agent-level breakdowns to see who consumed tokens, storage, or container time.
- Export CSVs for finance or connect dashboards via the MeshAgent APIs for automation.

## Mail 

Mail is where you provision and monitor the mailbox queues used by MailBot-style workflows:

- Create mailboxes, assign them to rooms, and pick the email address domain provided by MeshAgent.
- Map incoming messages to queues so worker agents can process them asynchronously.
- Inspect delivery status, retry counts, and recent messages for quick debugging.

## Billing 
The Billing tab provides credit information and can be used to: 
- Add or update payment methods, set spend alerts, and track applied credits.
- Download invoices, view upcoming charges, and share read-only billing access with finance teams.
- Pause projects or downgrade plans if you need to stop consumption temporarily.

## Next Steps
- Follow the [Getting Started guide](./get_started) to create your first project and room.
- Use the [CLI quickstarts](../cli/getting_started) to complement what you configure in Studio.
- When you are ready for production, read the [Services deployment docs](../services_room_containers/overview) to package agents and tools as managed services.
