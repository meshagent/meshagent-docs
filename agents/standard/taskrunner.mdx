title: "TaskRunner"
---

A TaskRunner is an agent that produces inputs and outputs that match an input and output json schema. It joins a Meshagent Room and can be discovered and 
invoked from the Studio using the "Run Task..." menu option or using the ```room.agents.ask``` method on the API.

Every Meshagent room also contains two Task Runner agents that can be used for basic tasks by providing them a custom set of tools:

GenericTaskRunner - a task runner that takes in a prompt an optional set of custom tools, and returns a text response.
PlanningResponder - a task runner that takes in a prompt an optional set of custom tools, and returns a structured response.

These built in agents can be useful helpers in your own apps. For example, when you invoke an agent inside the Meshagent Studio, the PlanningResponder is used 
to generate user interface on the fly and gather the required JSON data to pass as input when invoking an agent. Extending the base Task Runner and providing
a custom set of rules and tools is a great way to get a simple agent up and running quickly.

TaskRunners can also be surfaced in toolkits and used as tools that can be used by other agents using the RunTaskTool. Exposing agents as tools and then
giving those tools to a ChatBot is a great way to get started building multi agent systems.
