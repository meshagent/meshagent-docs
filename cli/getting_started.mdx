## Overview
This guide covers common CLI workflows for day-to-day MeshAgent development. If you haven't set up MeshAgent yet, start with the [Getting Started Guide](../introduction/get_started) first. This will walk you through creating a MeshAgent account, installing MeshAgent, and running your first agent from the CLI. 

The MeshAgent CLI streamlines Room interactions and agent management right from your terminal. With the MeshAgent CLI you can easily:

- Authenticate and activate projects
- Spin up live rooms and test your in progress agents and tools
- Deploy services to your project or room
- Inspect and manage existing projects, secrets, agents, and services

For a complete command reference, see [MeshAgent CLI Commands](../reference/meshagent_cli_help) documentation.

## Before you begin
1. **Set up MeshAgent**: If you haven't installed MeshAgent yet, follow our [Getting Started](../introduction/get_started) guide. This will walk you through how to set up your MeshAgent account, create your first project, install MeshAgent, and connect to your first room with your first agent.

2. **Install the MeshAgent CLI**: You can install the CLI globally on your system or in a virtual environment. 
    **To install the CLI globally:**
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash macOS
    brew tap meshagent/homebrew-meshagent
    # install the latest version
    brew install meshagent
    # Display the help
    meshagent --help
    ```
    ```bash Windows
    # Install
    choco install meshagent
    # Display the help
    meshagent --help

    # Alternatively:
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://storage.googleapis.com/meshagent-cli-builds/0.21.0/meshagent.0.21.0.nupkg" -OutFile "C:\Downloads\meshagent.0.21.0.nupkg"
    choco install meshagent --source "C:\Downloads\meshagent.0.21.0.nupkg"
    ```
    ```bash Other
    # One can install the meshagent cli using pipx
    pipx install "meshagent[cli]" --include-deps
    # Optional: ensure meshagent is in the path. 
    # You may need to open a new terminal.
    pipx ensurepath
    # Display the help
    meshagent --help
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    **To install the CLI in a virtual environment:** Ensure you are in the appropriate project folder and have activated your virtual environment. (The virtual environment is active when the terminal prompt starts with ``venv``.) If you need help with your machine setup check out our [Machine Setup Guide for Python](../reference/machine_setup). Then you can install all the MeshAgent packages, or exclusively the MeshAgent CLI.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash pip
    pip install "meshagent[cli]" # or "meshagent[all]"
    ```
    ```bash uv
    uv add "meshagent[cli]" # or "meshagent[all]"
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

3. **Authenticate**: Once the CLI is installed, authenticate and activate a project. 
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash bash
    # A browser window will open for OAUTH.
    meshagent setup
    # Then you will be prompted to activate a project
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    __Optional__: Alternatively, instead of running the `meshagent setup` command you can run:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash bash
    # A browser window will open for OAUTH.
    meshagent auth login
    meshagent project activate -i
    # create an api key if necessary. The key value will be displayed only once.
    meshagent api-key create --activate my-key
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    You are now authenticated and ready to use the CLI! 

## Common Workflows
### Test Agents Locally

Before deploying, test your agent locally in a room:

#### Using CLI agents (no code required)
The MeshAgent CLI provides prebuilt [ChatBot](../agents/standard/chatbot) and [VoiceBot](../agents/standard/voicebot) agents you can test instantly:

```bash
# Authenticate to MeshAgent if not already signed in
meshagent setup

# Test a chatbot
meshagent chatbot join --room testroom --agent-name myagent

# Test a voicebot  
meshagent voicebot join --room testroom --agent-name myvoice

# Test a chatbot with tools enabled
meshagent chatbot join --room testroom --web-search --storage
```

Open [MeshAgent Studio](https://studio.meshagent.com), join `testroom`, and start chatting with your agents.

> **Tip:** Use `--help` to see all available tools and options: `meshagent chatbot join --help`. The CLI ChatBot has built in tools you can turn on and off for things like image generation, web search, local shell, and mcp.

> **Note:** `chatbot join` / `voicebot join` are designed for local/dev usage. In containers or deployments, prefer `chatbot service` / `voicebot service`. 

#### Run your own MeshAgent service locally

The CLI based agents expose many tools and functionality already, we recommend using these for most use cases. When you need additional custom functionality you can extend the base agent classes, for example the `ChatBot`. To run a custom agent or tool locally and deploy it, expose it via `ServiceHost` (local webhook server). A request from MeshAgent spins up your agent or tool, connects it to the Room, and manages it's lifecycle for the session. 

For example, create a file called `my_agent.py`: 

<CodeGroup>
    <SimpleChatbot />
</CodeGroup>

Then run the service locally with the MeshAgent CLI: 

```bash bash
# Run your agent code locally in a room
meshagent service run "my_agent.py" --room testroom
```

Open [MeshAgent Studio](https://studio.meshagent.com), join `testroom`, and start chatting with your agent. You can iterate on the code and restart the service to test your changes (run `Ctrl+C` to stop the agent then rerun the `meshagent service run` command). The agent will only exist for the current session unless deployed.

### Package and Deploy Services 
Once your agent works locally, you'll need to [package](../services_room_containers/packaging_and_deploying/packaging) and [deploy](../services_room_containers/packaging_and_deploying/deployment) it as a project or room service. You can do this from MeshAgent Studio or using the CLI.

For example, let's deploy a CLI based chatbot with the web search tool, image generation tool, and storage tool. First copy this `meshagent.yaml` file. 

<CodeGroup>
    <CliChatBotYaml />
</CodeGroup>

Next, deploy it to your project or room. 

```bash bash 
# Deploy as a project service (available in all rooms)
meshagent service create --file meshagent.yaml

# Deploy as a room service (specific room only)
meshagent service create --file meshagent.yaml --room myroom
```

Inspect what's deployed: 

```bash
# List project services
meshagent service list

# List services in a room
meshagent service list --room=myroom

# View service details (ID comes from list command)
meshagent service show <service-id> 
```

Use your deployed services in [MeshAgent Studio](https://studio.meshagent.com) in any of the rooms it was deployed to.

### Manage Projects and Rooms 

**Switch projects:**
```bash
# List projects
meshagent project list

# Activate a different project
meshagent project activate -i
```

**Manage API keys:**
```bash
# Create and activate a new API key
meshagent api-key create --activate my-new-key

# List API keys
meshagent api-key list

# Delete API keys
meshagent api-key delete <api-key-id>
```

### Work with Secrets
[Secrets](../secrets/secrets_overview) allow you to store credentials securely for agents and services to use: 

When deploying a custom agent, you will need to build and push a docker image. For an example of this, checkout the [Deploying a ChatBot as a Project Service](../services_room_containers/packaging_and_deploying/project_service_example) guide where you'll learn how to build and deploy a chat agent as a project wide service.

If your docker image is not public, then you will need to configure a secret so that the image can be pulled.

<CodeGroup>
```bash bash
meshagent secret docker create --name my-image-secret --server index.docker.io --username my-username --password my-password
```
</CodeGroup>

You can also create key-value based secrets (for API keys, etc.):
```bash 
meshagent secret keys create --name my-secret --data my-key=my-value
```

### Logout 

Rooms will spin down automatically after you leave and they are inactive. 
If you wish to logout you can run:

<CodeGroup>
```bash bash
meshagent auth logout
```
</CodeGroup>
