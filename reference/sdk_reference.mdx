MeshAgent ships **official SDKs for Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, and Dart**. Every SDK exposes the same Room API for real-time messaging, webhooks, file management, and tools.

Today agents are available in the Python SDK and coming soon to JavaScript and Dart. TS/JS have additional UI features. 
All other capabilities (Rooms, messages, webhooks, files, tools, etc.) are supported across languages.
