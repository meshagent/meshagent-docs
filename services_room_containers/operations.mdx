title: Operations & Troubleshooting
---

Keep services and room containers healthy using MeshAgent Studio, the CLI, and built-in diagnostics.

## Observe Health
- **Readiness & liveness probes**: Define ``liveness`` paths in your manifest so MeshAgent knows when to expose participants.
- **Room logs**: MeshAgent Studio shows service start/stop events and out of the box and user defined otel logs, traces, ane metrics.
- **Metrics & logs**: Emit OpenTelemetry data using ``OTEL_ENDPOINT`` (MeshAgent injects this variable during runtime).

## View Logs
- Studio → Room → Services & Room Containers lists active instances with “View logs”.
- CLI commands:
  - Project service logs: ``meshagent service logs --name <service-name>`` (if available in your CLI version).
  - Room container logs: ``meshagent container logs --id <container-id> --follow``.

## Restart or Stop
- Project services restart automatically when a room becomes active again. Use ``meshagent service update`` with a new image tag to redeploy.
- Room containers must be stopped manually: ``meshagent container stop --id <container-id>`` or via the Studio UI.

## Diagnose Common Issues

| Symptom | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Service never appears in the room | Check readiness endpoint, ensure the port is exposed, and confirm the participant identity matches the manifest. |
| Container crashes on boot | View startup logs, verify image architecture is ``linux/amd64``, and ensure secrets/environment variables are present. |
| Unauthorized API calls | Confirm ``MESHAGENT_TOKEN`` has the required role; for project services set ``role`` or per-endpoint roles. |
| File access errors | Validate storage mounts and subpaths, and ensure the container user has permissions for the mount path. |
| Port conflicts | Use auto-assigned ports (``num: "*"``) and rely on ``MESHAGENT_PORT`` inside your code. |

## Clean Up Resources
- Delete unused project services in Studio to stop automatic launches.
- Remove stale room containers from the Room → Services & Room Containers panel.
- Prune unused images in your registry to reduce storage costs.

## Automation Tips
- Use CI to build and push images with ``docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64``.
- Add integration tests that run ``meshagent service run`` against a staging room.
- When rolling out breaking changes, deploy a new service name alongside the old one so rooms can transition gradually.
