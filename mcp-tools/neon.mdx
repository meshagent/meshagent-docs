title: Neon
---


This workflow deploys an MCP Neon server and toolkit to a test Meshagent Room in the cloud, suitable for evaluation, prototyping, or short-lived automation sessions. When the Room closes, all services—MCP server, chatbot, and tools—are also terminated.

1. **Install Meshagent with all features:**
   ```bash
   pip install "meshagent[all]"
   ```

2. **Sign up and authenticate:**  
   [Follow steps at Meshagent CLI Getting Started](https://docs.meshagent.com/cli/getting_started)

3. **Start a Room-level MCP server agent:**
   ```bash
   meshagent service test --room=test --role=agent --image=meshagent/mcp-neon:latest --env MESHAGENT_PORT=8001  --port="num=8001 path=/webhook liveness=/ type=meshagent.callable" --name=mcp-neon-service-test
   ```
   - **This creates a temporary room** (`--room=test`) and launches the Neon MCP server in the room as a cloud agent. The service and room will be auto-removed if inactive.

4. **Launch a chatbot in the room with the Neon toolkit:**
   ```bash
   meshagent chatbot join --room=test --agent-name=mcp-neon --name=mcp-neon --toolkit=mcp-neon
   ```
   - **Multiple toolkits** can be used per room with the same agent.
   - The command output will provide a URL to access the room.

5. **Test the integration:**  
   Open the provided room URL in your browser, and chat with the agent. Any requests will be handled using the Neon MCP server’s tools.

## Project Level Deployment: Persistent Services for All Rooms

For production use, you can create persistent agents in your Meshagent project that automatically join every new project room. This ensures the MCP server and tool-enabled chatbot are always available—no manual setup or process hosting needed.

1. **Create a persistent MCP server agent:**
   ```bash
   meshagent service create --role=agent --image=meshagent/mcp-neon:latest --env MESHAGENT_PORT=8001  --port="num=8001 path=/webhook liveness=/ type=meshagent.callable" --name=mcp-neon-service
   ```

2. **Create a persistent chatbot with the Neon toolkit:**
   ```bash
   meshagent service create \
     --image="meshagent/cli:latest" \
     --port="num=9001 path=/agent liveness=/ type=meshagent.callable participant_name=mcp-neon-chatbot" \
     --env="MESHAGENT_PORT=9001" \
     --name="mcp-neon-chatbot-service" \
     --command="meshagent chatbot service --agent-name=mcp-neon-chatbot --toolkit=mcp-neon"
   ```

Once these services are set up, **every new Meshagent room in your project** will automatically get a live MCP server agent and Neon-toolkit-enabled chatbot, eliminating the need to run or manage these processes separately.
