In addition to MeshAgent Tools, agents can also use external tools through [OpenAI Connectors and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-connectors-mcp). 

- **OpenAI Connectors**: OpenAI-maintained MCP wrappers for third party services that don't have official MCP servers (Gmail, Google Drive, Outlook, Microsoft Teams, Dropbox etc.). Using these connectors requires OAuth client registration and authorization with the provider. 
- **Remote MCP servers**: Any MCP server operated by you or a third party. You provide the server URL and any required authentication details, and the agent can call the server's MCP tools. 

## Ways to Use Connectors & MCP Servers
- **Always-available toolkits**: Create an agent and explicitly pass these tools via the agent's `toolkits` parameter (easiest way to get started).
- **Dynamically-available toolkits**: Package the Connector or MCP Server as a MeshAgent [Service](../../services_room_containers/overview) and use UI hooks to let users enable/disable specific tools per conversation or message. This is automatically supported in MeshAgent Studio when running the CLI chatbot with the mcp flag (`meshagent chatbot join --room=myroom --mcp`). 

In both cases, MeshAgent talks to OpenAI via the [`OpenAIResponsesAdapter`](../adapters/openai_responses_adapter). This adapter gathers the toolkits available to the agent on that turn, manages tool execution, streaming responses, and returning the final result. 

## Example: Create an Agent with MCP Tools

Let's create a [`ChatBot`](../agents/chatbot) that can use the public [DeepWiki MCP Server](https://docs.devin.ai/work-with-devin/deepwiki-mcp) which does not require an access token or OAuth. 

<CodeGroup>
  <MCPChatBot />
</CodeGroup>

Run it locally and try it in MeshAgent Studio:

```bash bash 
meshagent service run "main.py" --room=myroom
```

From [MeshAgent Studio](https://studio.meshagent.com), enter `myroom`, and start talking to the agent. Ask it about public GitHub repositories and it will use the DeepWiki MCP tools to respond. 

### Package and deploy the agent
Once satisfied with the agent, we can package and deploy it as a project service so it's automatically available to all the rooms in a project, or as a room service so it's always available in a specific room. To do so we'll create a Dockerfile, build/push the image, create a yaml file that defines the service, then deploy it using the MeshAgent CLI. 

**Step 1: Create the Dockerfile**

```Dockerfile Dockerfile
FROM meshagent/python-sdk-slim:latest
COPY . /src
WORKDIR /src
ENTRYPOINT [ "python3", "main.py" ]
```

**Step 2: Build and Push the Image**

```bash 
docker buildx build . \
  -t "$IMAGE:$TAG" \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  --push
```

**Step 3: Define the Service**

```yaml yaml
kind: Service
version: v1
metadata:
  name: mcp-deepwiki-chatbot
  description: "Expose a ChatBot with access to DeepWiki MCP server"
ports:
- num: "*" 
  type: http
  liveness: "/"
  endpoints:
  - path: /mcp-deepwiki-chatbot
    meshagent:
      identiy: "mcp-deepwiki-chatbot"
container:
  image: "IMAGE:TAG"
```

**Step 4: Deploy**

```bash bash
meshagent service create --file "meshagent.yaml" # optional --room=myroom 
```

**Step 5: Try it out!**

Next open [MeshAgent Studio](https://studio.meshagent.com), go to a room where the service is deployed, and begin talking to the ChatBot.

## Conclusion

Adding OpenAI Connectors and MCP Servers to your agent is a great way to give them access to third party services. As you enable these services for your agents be mindful of what information you are sharing with the services, who is hosting the servers, and whether you want to require approval or limit the allowed tools for agent use. 

For agents that should always have certain capabilities, (e.g., a support agent with access to an internal ticketing MCP server), the always-available toolkit approach outlined on this page is ideal. 

If you want a ChatGPT/Claude style experience where users can add or remove tools as needed see the [Dynamic Toolkits](./dynamic_openai_connectors_mcp) documentation.
