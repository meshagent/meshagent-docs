## Installing  client

This guide will help you configure **Meshagent** across various environments: Browser, Node.js, Python, and Dart/Flutter.


To get started, install the MeshAgent API:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Python
pip3 install meshagent-api
```
```bash JavaScript
npm install meshagent-api
```
```bash TypeScript
npm install meshagent-api
```
```bash Dart
dart pub add meshagent_api
```
</CodeGroup>


## Set Environment Variables

Before you begin, you **must** export three environment variables. Make sure to substitute the placeholder values (`xxxx-xxxx...`) with your actual keys and secrets.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Bash
export MESHAGENT_KEY_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
export MESHAGENT_PROJECT_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
export MESHAGENT_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
</CodeGroup>


## Connecting to a room

To connect to a room, you need a room URL and an authorized token for that room. You can generate tokens through the MeshAgent Admin Console or programmatically. Let’s connect to a room and create a document:

<CodeGroup>
  <QuickstartDocumentPy />
  <QuickstartDocumentJs />
  <QuickstartDocumentTs />
  <QuickstartDocumentDart />
</CodeGroup>

Because Mesh documents automatically synchronize with all participants, if you also connect to the room in the MeshAgent Admin Console and open the document, you’ll see the content update in real time when you run this sample.


## Asking an agent

What if we want an agent to fill out the document for us? MeshAgent makes it easy to ask for agent assistance. As before, if you open this document in the MeshAgent Admin Console, you will see the changes occur in real time:

<CodeGroup>
  <QuickstartAgentPy />
  <QuickstartAgentJs />
  <QuickstartAgentTs />
  <QuickstartAgentDart />
</CodeGroup>
