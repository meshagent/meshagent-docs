The following steps walk you through launching an MCP server and chatbot agent within a Meshagent Room for cloud-based testing. Both the tool and agent automatically stop when the room closes.

1. **Install Meshagent & Full Feature Set**
   ```sh
   pip install "meshagent[all]"
   ```

2. **Sign Up & Authenticate**
   - Create an account and authenticate per Meshagent docs:
   - [Getting Started with Meshagent CLI](https://docs.meshagent.com/cli/getting_started)

3. **Start a Test MCP Server as a Cloud Room Service**
   ```sh
   meshagent service test --room=test --role=agent --image=meshagent/mcp-memory:latest --env MESHAGENT_PORT=8001 --port="num=8001 path=/webhook liveness=/ type=meshagent.callable" --name=mcp-memory-service-test
   ```
   - This will launch a Meshagent Room in the cloud named `test` with an MCP server running as a service in that room.
   - The MCP server (`mcp-memory-service-test`) and its tools will be live only as long as the room is active.

4. **Add a Chatbot Agent with the MCP Memory Toolkit**
   ```sh
   meshagent chatbot join --room=test --agent-name=mcp-memory --name=mcp-memory --toolkit=mcp-memory
   ```
   - This launches a chatbot linked to the MCP memory toolkit within the same room.
   - Multiple toolkits may be assigned to a single agent.
   - The command output provides a browser link to join the room interactively.

5. **Test the Tools**
   - Visit the room link in your browser.
   - Send a message to the agent to interact with the MCP server tools directly in the room chat interface.

## Project Level Deployment

For production and persistent deployments: Register services at the Meshagent project level, so every newly created Room automatically gains access to the MCP server tools and a chatbotâ€”no need to run them locally or as separate processes. This makes MCP toolkits and agents available across all rooms.

1. **Create the MCP Memory Service Project-Wide**
   ```sh
   meshagent service create --role=agent --image=meshagent/mcp-memory:latest --env MESHAGENT_PORT=8001 --port="num=8001 path=/webhook liveness=/ type=meshagent.callable" --name=mcp-memory-service
   ```

2. **Create the MCP Memory Chatbot Project-Wide**
   ```sh
   meshagent service create --image="meshagent/cli:latest" --port="num=9001 path=/agent liveness=/ type=meshagent.callable participant_name=mcp-memory-chatbot" --env="MESHAGENT_PORT=9001" --name="mcp-memory-chatbot-service" --command="meshagent chatbot service --agent-name=mcp-memory-chatbot --toolkit=mcp-memory"
   ```
