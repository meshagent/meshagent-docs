title: Run Your Service Locally

Build and test services on your machine, then deploy them as either a project service or a run it as a room service through the Containers API.

## ServiceHost Basics
MeshAgent's ``ServiceHost`` exposes your agents or tools as HTTP webhook endpoints. When you create a ``ServiceHost``, it starts an HTTP server that listens for incoming webhook requests from MeshAgent. When a webhook call arrives, the ``ServiceHost`` automatically spins up your agent or tool, connects it to the requested room, and manages its lifecycle until the session ends. 

Let's define a simple chatbot service: 
<CodeGroup>
    <SimpleChatbot/>
</CodeGroup>

> **Note**: MeshAgent automatically assigns an available port to your service. You can set a specific port by passing the ``MESHAGENT_PORT`` environment variable or passing a port to the ``ServiceHost`` constructor. For example, ``host = ServiceHost(port=9000)`` or ``host = ServiceHost(port=int(os.getenv("MESHAGENT_PORT", "9001")))``.

## Run Locally with the CLI
Save the code above as ``main.py`` and run:

```bash
meshagent setup  # authenticate once
meshagent service run "main.py" --room=myroom
```

You should see output similar to:
```
Connecting to room...
Connecting port 8081...
Connecting endpoint /chat as chatbot...
INFO:services:starting -> 0.0.0.0:8081/chat -> SimpleChatbot
INFO:webhooks:received request http://localhost:8081/chat POST
INFO:services:chatbot answering call and joining room
```

The CLI command:
- Starts your ``ServiceHost`` HTTP server locally
- Discovers all ``@host.path`` endpoints automatically
- Calls each endpoint into the specified room using the declared identity

Open [studio.meshagent.com](https://studio.meshagent.com), enter ``myroom``, and you will see the ``chatbot`` participant available for interaction.

## Iterate Quickly
1. Implement your agent or tool and register endpoints with ``ServiceHost``.
2. Run ``meshagent service run "main.py" --room=myroom`` to connect it to a test room.
3. Interact via [MeshAgent Studio](https://studio.meshagent.com), adjust code, and restart the CLI command as needed.
4. Add more endpoints to the same ``ServiceHost`` if you want to bundle related agents/tools together.

## Working with multiple agents or tools in a single service

You can register multiple agents or tools in a single ``ServiceHost`` using different paths. This makes it easy to bundle related agents and tools together into a single deployable service. 

```python Python
service = ServiceHost()

@service.path(path="/chat", identity="chatbot")
class ChatAgent(ChatBot):
    # ... chat agent implementation

@service.path(path="/dataanalysis", identity="data-analsis-tool") 
class DataAnalysis(Tool):
    # ... data analysis tool implementation

@service.path(path="/helper", identity="task-helper")
class HelperAgent(TaskRunner):
    # ... helper agent implementation
```

Using ``meshagent service run "main.py" --room=myroom`` will automatically detect and call all three endpoints into the room with their respective identities.

## Next Steps
- Determine if you want to deploy your service at the project level or run it in a specific room with the Containers API. See [Intro to Services and Containers](./overview) for details.
- Create a Dockerfile and service manifest for either a [project service](./project_services/configuration) or a [room service](./room_containers/configuration).
- Create any required secure credentials before deployment via [secrets & registry access](../secrets/secrets).
