title: "Observability"

When invoking tools via the room API, Meshagent will automatically track observability data such as who called a tool, how long the tool took to return a result, and what room the tool was used in.

Meshagent tools also support returning custom metrics. When creating a Response, you can optionally pass a key-value dictionary of custom usage metrics. It will automatically be available in reports and associated with the tool.
